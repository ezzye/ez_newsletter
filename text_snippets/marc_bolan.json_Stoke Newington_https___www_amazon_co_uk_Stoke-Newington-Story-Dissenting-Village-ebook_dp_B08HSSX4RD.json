In more recent years, it was associated with the Kray Twins, the Angry Brigade and the Provisional IRA, as well as with a range of creative individuals including Harold Pinter, Paul Foot and Marc Bolan.|Today, the neighbourhood is inhabited by a richly eclectic blend of nationalities and cultures. It is a home for inner-city dwellers of all types, from writers and artists to musicians, journalists and actors. Its appeal has led to its contemporary gentrification, making it a rather different place to the somewhat down-at-heel neighbourhood of the 1960s and 1970s.|This book reveals, through anecdote, historical fact and cultural insight, how this often perverse, argumentative yet tolerant 'village' has become today's fashionable and desirable Stoke Newington.|Read more|Previous page|Print length|210 pages|Language|English|Sticky notes|On Kindle Scribe|Publisher|The History Press|Publication date|31 Mar. 2021|File size|3731 KB|Page Flip|Enabled|Word Wise|Enabled|Enhanced typesetting|Enabled|See all details|Next page|Kindle e-Readers|Kindle (5th Generation)|Kindle Keyboard|Kindle DX|Kindle (2nd Generation)|Kindle (1st Generation)|Kindle Paperwhite|Kindle Paperwhite (5th Generation)|Kindle Touch|Kindle Voyage|Kindle|Kindle Oasis|Kindle Fire Tablets|Kindle Fire HD|Kindle Fire|Kindle Fire HDX 8.9''|Kindle Fire HDX|Kindle Fire (3rd Generation)|Fire HDX 8.9 Tablet|Fire HD 7 Tablet|Fire HD 6 Tablet|Fire HD 10|Fire HD 8|Fire|Fire Phones|Fire Phone|Free Kindle Reading Apps|Kindle for Windows 8|Kindle Cloud Reader|Kindle for Windows Phone|Kindle for BlackBerry|Kindle for Android|Kindle for Android Tablets|Kindle for iPhone|Kindle for iPod Touch|Kindle for iPad|Available on these devices|From the Publisher|Product description|About the Author|RAB MACWILLIAM is well known locally as a prolific author, editor and publisher of numerous books and magazines.
