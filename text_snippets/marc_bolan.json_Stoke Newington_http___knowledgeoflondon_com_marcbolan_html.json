Marc left school as soon as he could in 1962 and about the same time moved from his Stoke Newington Common home. He briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy,\" appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store.|His first stage name was Toby Tyler, which he took from a film of the same name, before he settled, sometime later, for Marc Bolan, Bolan coming from the first two and last three letters of his hero Bo(b) (Dy)lan|He is best known as the founder of the British rock band Tyrannosaurus Rex, which was later abbreviated to T. Rex. His music, as well as his highly original sense of style and extraordinary stage presence, helped create the glam rock era which made him one of the most recognizable stars in British rock music.|Marc was to spend his last night in Morton\u0092s bar and restaurant at Berkeley Square, along with his girlfriend Gloria Jones, who drove him home in her Mini 1275GT (registration FOX 661L). Marc never took a driving test or had a licence. He died instantly when Jones lost control of the car and it struck a sycamore tree after failing to negotiate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, in South West London at 5 a.m. on 16 September 1977."
