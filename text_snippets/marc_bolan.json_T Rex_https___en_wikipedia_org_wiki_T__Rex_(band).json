          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",

          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",
          "|edit|]|Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967, following a handful of failed solo singles and a brief career as lead guitarist in psych-rock band|John's Children|. After a solitary disastrous performance as a four-piece electric rock band on 22 July at the Electric Garden in London's|Covent Garden|alongside drummer Steve Porter plus two older musicians: guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bassist, the group immediately broke up.|[2]|[3]|Subsequently, Bolan retained the band name and the services of Porter, who switched to percussion under the name Steve Peregrin Took, and the two began performing acoustic material as a duo with a repertoire of folk-influenced Bolan-penned songs. Inspired by an influential performance by|Ravi Shankar|whom Bolan had seen while touring West Germany with John's Children, the band adopted a stage manner resembling the performance of traditional Indian music.|[3]|[4]|The combination of Bolan's|acoustic guitar|and distinctive vocal style with Took's|bongos|and assorted percussion\u2014which often included children's instruments such as the|Pixiphone|\u2014earned them a devoted following in the thriving|hippy|underground scene.|BBC Radio One|Disc jockey|John Peel|championed the band early in their recording career.|[5]|Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer|Tony Visconti|, who went on to produce the band's albums well into their second,|glam rock|phase.|[6]|Their debut album|My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair...|remained in the|UK Albums chart|for nine weeks and peaked at number 15.|[7]|Their second album|Prophets, Seers & Sages|was released a few months later.|During 1968\u20131969, Tyrannosaurus Rex had become a modest success on radio and on record. Their third single \"Pewter Suitor\", released in January 1969, failed to chart but their third album|Unicorn|came within striking distance of the|UK Top 10 Albums|.|[7]|While Bolan's early solo material was|rock and roll|-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and|baroque|songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with|Greek|and|Persian mythology|as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.|[8]|Their fourth single \"King of the Rumbling Spires\" issued in July, was a musical departure compared to the previous material: they used a full rock band setup with a drumkit and an entirely electric sound.  However, by mid-1969 there was a rift developing between the two halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Bolan working on his book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|and concentrating on his songs and performance skills. Took, however, had fully embraced the anti-commercial,|drug|-taking ethos of the|UK Underground|scene centred around|Ladbroke Grove|. Took was also attracted to anarchic elements such as|Mick Farren|/|Deviants|and members of the|Pink Fairies|Rock 'n' Roll and Drinking Club.|[9]|Took also began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his bandmate's efforts, rejecting them for the duo's putative fourth album, in production in Spring/Summer 1969. In response to Bolan's rebuff, Took contributed two songs as well as vocals and percussion to|Twink|'s|Think Pink|album.|[10]|Behind the scenes, Bolan's relationship with Took ended after this dispute, although they were contractually obliged to go through with a US tour which was doomed before it began. Poorly promoted and planned, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, Took drew from the|shock rock|style of|Iggy Pop|; Took explained, \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of|Los Angeles|shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"|[11]|Bolan returned to the UK in September and advertised for a replacement for Took. A month later he recruited percussionist|Mickey Finn|.|[6]|and they completed the fourth album, released in early 1970 as|A Beard of Stars|, the final album under the Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. This line up headlined the very first|Glastonbury Festival|in 1970.|[12]|As well as progressively shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums began to show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound.|[13]|Glam rock and commercial success (July 1970 \u2013 December 1972)|[|edit|]|Bolan continued the process of simplification by shortening the band's name to T. Rex.|[14]|The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, \"|Ride a White Swan|\" recorded in July and released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and would soon reach number 2.|[7]|Ticket fees were reduced to 10 shillings/50p to attract a younger audience.|[15]|The eponymous first|T. Rex|album, also recorded that summer, was released in December and continued the move to electric guitars.|[13]|In early 1971,|T. Rex|reached the top 20 of the official|UK Albums Chart|.|[14]|During the February\u2013April 1971 suspension of the official album chart (caused by|a national postal strike|) a chart by|Melody Maker|\u2014which the|Official Chart Company|'s website nowadays recognises as canonical for the gap period\u2014listed the LP as having peaked at number 7.|[16]|[17]|\"Ride a White Swan\" was quickly followed by a second single, \"|Hot Love|\", which reached the top spot on the UK charts, and remained there for six weeks.|[7]|Between these two releases, Bolan first recruited bassist|Steve Currie|, and then drummer|Bill Legend|, to form a full band to record and tour to growing audiences.  After Chelita Secunda added two spots of glitter under Bolan's eyes before an appearance on|Top of the Pops|for which Bolan wore shiny satin trousers and a shiny jacket (from Chelsea boutique Alkasura) in place of his previous hippy clothes, soon followed by another appearance for the show on which he wore a silver velvet/satin sailor suit, the ensuing performances would often be viewed as the birth of glam rock.|After Bolan's displays, glam rock would gain popularity in the UK and Europe during 1971\u20131972. The completion of T. Rex's move to electric guitar rock coincided with Bolan's more overtly sexual lyrical style and image. Having already begun standing up onstage to perform electric songs, Bolan also incorporated more physical showmanship, such as struts, dances and poses, into his stage act.  The group's new image and sound quickly attracted a new audience much to the despair of the band's early fans. Some of the lyrical content of Tyrannosaurus Rex remained, but the poetic, surrealistic lyrics were now interspersed with sensuous grooves, orgiastic moans and innuendo.|In September 1971, T. Rex released|Electric Warrior|, which featured Currie and Legend. Often considered to be their best album, the chart-topping|Electric Warrior|brought much commercial success to the group;|[7]|publicist|BP Fallon|coined the term \"T. Rextasy\" as a parallel to|Beatlemania|to describe the group's popularity.|[18]|The album included T. Rex's best-known song, \"|Get It On|\", which hit number one in the UK. In January 1972 it became a top ten hit in the US, where the song was retitled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\". The album still recalled Bolan's acoustic roots with ballads such as \"Cosmic Dancer\" and the stark \"Girl\". Soon after, Bolan left|Fly Records|; after his contract had lapsed, the label released the album track \"|Jeepster|\" as a single without his permission. Bolan went to|EMI|, where he was given his own record label in the UK\u2014T. Rex Records, the \"T. Rex Wax Co.\"|[3]|The band released the singles \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" respectively in January and in May 1972, and both became number one hits in the UK.|[7]|In May, Bolan's old label Fly released the chart-topping compilation album|Bolan Boogie|, a collection of singles, B-sides and LP tracks, which affected  sales of the band's forthcoming album. When  it was released in July,|The Slider|peaked at number four in the UK,|[7]|and it became their most successful album in the US, entering the top 20 of the|Billboard|200|.|[19]|The band then released two other standalone singles \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\" which both reached number 2 in the UK. In December, Bolan's own rock film|Born to Boogie|was released  to theatres. The film featured two T. Rex shows at the|Empire Pool, Wembley|, which had been shot by|Ringo Starr|and his crew earlier in the year.|Transition, decline and resurgence (January 1973 \u2013 September 1977)|[|edit|]|Bolan performing on ABC's|In Concert|, 1973|Tanx|was a commercial success, reaching number 3 in the German Albums chart,|[20]|number 4 in the UK,|[7]|and number 5 in Norway.|[20]|An eclectic album containing several melancholy ballads and rich production,|Tanx|showcased the T. Rex sound bolstered by extra instrumental embellishments such as|Mellotron|and saxophone. \"The Street and Babe Shadow\" was|funkier|while the last song \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\" was seen by critics as a nod to|gospel|with several female backing singers.|[21]|Released at the same time in March 1973, the heavy rock \"|20th Century Boy|\" was another important success, peaking at number 3 in the UK Singles chart but was not included in the album.|[7]|\"|The Groover|\" marked the end of the golden era in which T. Rex scored 11 singles in a row in the UK top ten.|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|was released in February 1974, and reached number 12 in the UK. Musically, the band ventured into|blue-eyed soul|and blended rock with funk and|R & B|influences.|[22]|Lyrically, the album harkened back to the Tyrannosaurus Rex days with long song titles and lyrical complexity, but was not a critical success. In the US, Warner Brothers dropped the band without releasing the album. Bill Legend stopped working with Bolan at that time. T. Rex had an extended line-up which included second guitarist|Jack Green|and|B. J. Cole|on pedal steel. Soon after the album's release, Bolan split with producer Visconti, then in December 1974, Finn also left the band. A single, \"|Zip Gun Boogie|\", appeared in late 1974 credited as a Marc Bolan solo effort (though still on the T. Rex label). It only reached UK No. 41, and the T. Rex band identity was quickly re-established.|Bolan's Zip Gun|(1975) saw the group further developing the soul and funk of previous records. Most of the material had already been released the previous year in the US as|Light of Love|. It was self-produced by Bolan who, in addition to writing the songs, gave his music a harder, more futuristic sheen. Bolan's own productions were not well received in the music press. However, in the US,|Rolling Stone|magazine gave it a positive review.|[23]|During this time Bolan became increasingly isolated, while high tax rates in the UK drove him into|exile|in Monte Carlo and the US. No longer a vegetarian, Bolan put on weight due to consumption of hamburgers and alcohol, and was ridiculed in the music press.|T. Rex's penultimate album,|Futuristic Dragon|(1976), featured an inconsistent production style that veered from|Wall of Sound|-style songs to|disco|backing, with nostalgic nods to the old T. Rex boogie machine. It only managed to reach number 50, but the album was better received by the critics and featured the singles \"|New York City|\" (number 15 in the UK) and \"|Dreamy Lady|\" (number 30).|[7]|The latter was promoted as T. Rex Disco Party. To promote the album, the band toured the UK, and performed on television shows such as|Top of the Pops|,|Supersonic|and|Get It Together|.|In the summer of 1976, T. Rex released two more singles, \"|I Love to Boogie|\" (which charted at number 13) and \"|Laser Love|\", which made number 42.|[7]|In early 1977|Dandy in the Underworld|was released to critical acclaim. Bolan had slimmed down and regained his elfin looks, and the songs too had a stripped-down, streamlined sound. A spring UK tour with|punk|band|the Damned|on support garnered positive reviews. As Bolan was enjoying a new surge in popularity, he talked about performing again with Finn and Took, as well as reuniting with Visconti.  A six part|TV series|,|Marc|,|presented|by  Bolan and including multiple performances by T.Rex in each episode as well as other artists, was produced in|Manchester|by|Granada Television|for the|ITV|network.|[24]|Bolan's death, disbandment and reformation attempts|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan and his girlfriend|Gloria Jones|spent the evening of 15 September 1977 drinking at the Speakeasy and then dining at Morton's club on|Berkeley Square|, in|Mayfair|, Central London.|[25]|While driving home early in the morning of 16 September, Jones crashed Bolan's purple|Mini 1275 GT|into a tree (now the site of|Bolan's Rock Shrine|), after failing to navigate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, a few miles from his home at 142 Upper Richmond Road West in|East Sheen|.|[26]|While Jones was severely injured, Bolan was killed in the crash, two weeks before his 30th birthday.|[27]|As Bolan had been the only constant member of T. Rex and also the only composer and writer, his management disbanded the remaining group (keyboardist|Dino Dines|and drummer|Tony Newman|- there was a vacancy for bassist) immediately upon his death. Only Legend survives from the band prior to its commercial decline; Took went on to co-found|Pink Fairies|and appear on|Mick Farren|'s solo album|Mona \u2013 The Carnivorous Circus|before spending the 1970s working mostly on his own material, either solo or fronting bands such as|Shagrat|(1970\u20131971) and|Steve Took's Horns|(1977\u20131978).|[28]|He died in 1980 from asphyxiation caused by choking on a|cocktail cherry|.|[29]|The following year Currie, who had played for|Chris Spedding|before moving to Portugal in 1979, died there in a car crash.|[30]|Finn played as a|session musician|for|the Soup Dragons|and|the Blow Monkeys|before his death in 2003 of possible liver and kidney failure.|[31]|Since Bolan's death there have been two known public attempts by former members to reform the band. These have drawn strong criticism from fans and former associates of Bolan who contend that without a living Bolan, no such band can be an authentic lineup.|[32]|[33]|In 1997 Finn, Green and Legend's successor|Paul Fenton|formed a \"T.Rex\" lineup, soon renamed|Mickey Finn's T-Rex|, with former|Smokie|and|Saxon|members. Following Finn's death in 2003 the band continued on as T. Rex (A Celebration of Marc and Mickey) until a petition signed by Legend, Tony Visconti and David Bowie, among others, forced them to revert their name back to Mickey Finn's T-Rex with his family's blessing.|[32]|[34]|[35]|In 2014 Legend put together his own version of the band, Bill Legend's T. Rex, later known as|X-T. Rex|.|[36]|Influence and legacy|[|edit|]|T. Rex vastly influenced several genres over several decades including|glam rock|, the|punk|movement,|post-punk|,|indie pop|,|britpop|and|alternative rock|. They were cited by acts such as|New York Dolls|,|the Ramones|,|Kate Bush|,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|,|Joy Division|,|R.E.M.|,|the Smiths|,|the Pixies|and|Tricky|.|Sylvain Sylvain|of the New York Dolls said that when forming his band with|Billy Murcia|and|Johnny Thunders|: \"[they]'d all sit on the bed with these cheap guitars and do Marc Bolan songs, as well as some blues and instrumentals\".|[37]|Sparks|were inspired at their beginnings by Tyrannosaurus Rex, before T. Rex:|[38]|seeing them live \"was really our education\" stated|Ron Mael|.|[39]|The Stooges|were inspired by T. Rex when composing and recording the songs of|Raw Power|. Guitarist and songwriter|James Williamson|related: \"We were over in England at the time when Marc Bolan was red hot, and we were looking at his stuff and thinking 'hey, we could be like that,' and writing our stuff and just thinking it would take off.\"|[40]|Joey Ramone|of the Ramones said about Bolan: \"I get into people who are unique and innovative and have colour. That's why I love Marc Bolan. There was something so mystical about him, his singing voice, his manner. His songs really move ya, they're so moving and dark.\"|[41]|Siouxsie and the Banshees performed a cover version of \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career, eventually|releasing it as a B-side|in 1979. Joy Division's|Bernard Sumner|was marked by the sound of the guitar of early T. Rex; his musical journey began at a poppy level with \"Ride a White Swan\".|[42]|The Slits|' guitarist|Viv Albertine|was fascinated by Bolan's guitar playing: \"It was [...] the first time I ever listened to a guitar part. Because back then girls didn't really listen to guitar parts, it was a guy's thing. And guitars were really macho things then and I couldn't bear say, Hendrix's guitar playing, it was too in your face and too threateningly sexual, whereas Marc Bolan's guitar playing was kind of cartoony. And I could sing the parts. They weren't virtuoso, they were funny, they were humourous [|sic|] guitar parts.\"|[43]|Smiths' composer and guitarist|Johnny Marr|stated: \"T. Rex was pure pop\".|[44]|\"The influence of T. Rex is very profound on certain songs of the Smiths like \"|Panic|\" and \"|Shoplifters of the World Unite|\". Lead singer|Morrissey|also admired Bolan. While writing \"Panic\" he was inspired by \"Metal Guru\" and wanted to sing in the same style. He didn't stop singing it in an attempt to modify the words of \"Panic\" to fit the exact rhythm of \"Metal Guru\". Marr later stated: \"He also exhorted me to use the same guitar break so that the two songs are the same!\"|[45]|Marr rated Bolan in his ten favourite guitarists.|[46]|Prefab Sprout|'s|Paddy McAloon|cited \"Ride a White Swan\" as \"the song that vindicated my love of pop\".|[47]|R.E.M. covered live \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career in 1984:|[48]|singer|Michael Stipe|said that T. Rex and other groups of the 1970s \"were huge influences on all of us\",|[49]|\"[they] really impacted me\".|[50]|The Pixies's lead guitarist|Joey Santiago|cited|Electric Warrior|in his 13 defining records,|[51]|as did|the Jam|'s|Paul Weller|.|[52]|Santiago said: \"Bolan took the blues and made it a lot more palatable\".|[51]|Kate Bush listened to Bolan during her teenage years and then mentioned his name in the lyrics of the song \"Blow Away (for Bill)\".|[53]|Nick Cave|covered live \"Cosmic Dancer\",|[54]|commenting that|Electric Warrior|contained \"some of the greatest lyrics ever written\",|[55]|further adding, it was \"my favorite record, [...] the songs are so beautiful, it is an extraordinary record\".|[56]|Tricky cited Bolan as \"totally unique and ahead of his time\".|[57]|When talking about his favourite albums,|PJ Harvey|'s collaborator|John Parish|said that T. Rex \"is the place to start\", adding that \"this band and that album [|Electric Warrior|] was what got me into music in the first place\". When he saw T. Rex on Top of the Pops playing \"Jeepster\", he felt: \"that's my kind of music [...] The thing I related to as 12-year-old I still go back to and uses as one of my main touchstones when I'm making records\".|[58]|Parish explained, \"I've been listening to T.Rex pretty consistently since 1971\".|[59]|Oasis|\"borrowed\" the distinct guitar riff from \"Get It On\" on their single \"|Cigarettes & Alcohol|\".|[60]|Oasis's guitarist,|Noel Gallagher|, has cited T. Rex as a strong influence.|[61]|The early acoustic material was influential in helping to bring about|progressive rock|and 21st century|folk music|-influenced singers as|Devendra Banhart|,|[62]|who said: \"I love Tyrannosaurus Rex so much, it's so easy to love, so righteous to love, and so natural to love, I can't imagine anyone not liking it.\"|[63]|T. Rex are referenced in several popular songs, including|David Bowie|'s \"|All the Young Dudes|\" (which he wrote for|Mott the Hoople|in 1972),|[64]|the Ramones' \"|Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?|\",|[65]|Serge Gainsbourg|'s \"Ex-Fan Des Sixties\",|[66]|the Who|'s \"|You Better You Bet|\",|[67]|B A Robertson|'s \"Kool in the Kaftan\",|[68]|R.E.M.'s \"The Wake-Up Bomb\",|[69]|My Chemical Romance|'s \"Vampire Money\",|[70]|and|Panic! at the Disco|'s \"Middle of a Breakup\".|[71]|The music of T. Rex features in the soundtracks of various movies, including|Velvet Goldmine|,|[72]|Death Proof|,|[73]|Billy Elliot|,|[74]|the Bank Job|,|[75]|Dallas Buyers Club|,|[76]|and|Baby Driver|.|[77]|The sleeve of|The Slider|album can be seen in the|Lindsay Anderson|movie|O Lucky Man!|,|[78]|and in|Tim Burton|'s|Dark Shadows|.|[79]|In|Miha Mazzini|'s novel|King of the Rattling Spirits|, the narrator starts remembering his childhood when he sees Tyrannosaurus Rex record \"King of Rumbling Spires\" in the record store and realizes he has mistakenly remembered the title as \"King of the Rattling Spirits\".|[80]|Discography|[|edit|]|Main article:|T.

          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",

          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",
          "|edit|]|Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967, following a handful of failed solo singles and a brief career as lead guitarist in psych-rock band|John's Children|. After a solitary disastrous performance as a four-piece electric rock band on 22 July at the Electric Garden in London's|Covent Garden|alongside drummer Steve Porter plus two older musicians: guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bassist, the group immediately broke up.|[2]|[3]|Subsequently, Bolan retained the band name and the services of Porter, who switched to percussion under the name Steve Peregrin Took, and the two began performing acoustic material as a duo with a repertoire of folk-influenced Bolan-penned songs. Inspired by an influential performance by|Ravi Shankar|whom Bolan had seen while touring West Germany with John's Children, the band adopted a stage manner resembling the performance of traditional Indian music.|[3]|[4]|The combination of Bolan's|acoustic guitar|and distinctive vocal style with Took's|bongos|and assorted percussion\u2014which often included children's instruments such as the|Pixiphone|\u2014earned them a devoted following in the thriving|hippy|underground scene.|BBC Radio One|Disc jockey|John Peel|championed the band early in their recording career.|[5]|Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer|Tony Visconti|, who went on to produce the band's albums well into their second,|glam rock|phase.|[6]|Their debut album|My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair...|remained in the|UK Albums chart|for nine weeks and peaked at number 15.|[7]|Their second album|Prophets, Seers & Sages|was released a few months later.|During 1968\u20131969, Tyrannosaurus Rex had become a modest success on radio and on record. Their third single \"Pewter Suitor\", released in January 1969, failed to chart but their third album|Unicorn|came within striking distance of the|UK Top 10 Albums|.|[7]|While Bolan's early solo material was|rock and roll|-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and|baroque|songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with|Greek|and|Persian mythology|as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.|[8]|Their fourth single \"King of the Rumbling Spires\" issued in July, was a musical departure compared to the previous material: they used a full rock band setup with a drumkit and an entirely electric sound.  However, by mid-1969 there was a rift developing between the two halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Bolan working on his book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|and concentrating on his songs and performance skills. Took, however, had fully embraced the anti-commercial,|drug|-taking ethos of the|UK Underground|scene centred around|Ladbroke Grove|. Took was also attracted to anarchic elements such as|Mick Farren|/|Deviants|and members of the|Pink Fairies|Rock 'n' Roll and Drinking Club.|[9]|Took also began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his bandmate's efforts, rejecting them for the duo's putative fourth album, in production in Spring/Summer 1969. In response to Bolan's rebuff, Took contributed two songs as well as vocals and percussion to|Twink|'s|Think Pink|album.|[10]|Behind the scenes, Bolan's relationship with Took ended after this dispute, although they were contractually obliged to go through with a US tour which was doomed before it began. Poorly promoted and planned, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, Took drew from the|shock rock|style of|Iggy Pop|; Took explained, \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of|Los Angeles|shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"|[11]|Bolan returned to the UK in September and advertised for a replacement for Took. A month later he recruited percussionist|Mickey Finn|.|[6]|and they completed the fourth album, released in early 1970 as|A Beard of Stars|, the final album under the Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. This line up headlined the very first|Glastonbury Festival|in 1970.|[12]|As well as progressively shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums began to show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound.|[13]|Glam rock and commercial success (July 1970 \u2013 December 1972)|[|edit|]|Bolan continued the process of simplification by shortening the band's name to T. Rex.|[14]|The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, \"|Ride a White Swan|\" recorded in July and released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and would soon reach number 2.|[7]|Ticket fees were reduced to 10 shillings/50p to attract a younger audience.|[15]|The eponymous first|T. Rex|album, also recorded that summer, was released in December and continued the move to electric guitars.|[13]|In early 1971,|T. Rex|reached the top 20 of the official|UK Albums Chart|.|[14]|During the February\u2013April 1971 suspension of the official album chart (caused by|a national postal strike|) a chart by|Melody Maker|\u2014which the|Official Chart Company|'s website nowadays recognises as canonical for the gap period\u2014listed the LP as having peaked at number 7.|[16]|[17]|\"Ride a White Swan\" was quickly followed by a second single, \"|Hot Love|\", which reached the top spot on the UK charts, and remained there for six weeks.|[7]|Between these two releases, Bolan first recruited bassist|Steve Currie|, and then drummer|Bill Legend|, to form a full band to record and tour to growing audiences.  After Chelita Secunda added two spots of glitter under Bolan's eyes before an appearance on|Top of the Pops|for which Bolan wore shiny satin trousers and a shiny jacket (from Chelsea boutique Alkasura) in place of his previous hippy clothes, soon followed by another appearance for the show on which he wore a silver velvet/satin sailor suit, the ensuing performances would often be viewed as the birth of glam rock.|After Bolan's displays, glam rock would gain popularity in the UK and Europe during 1971\u20131972. The completion of T. Rex's move to electric guitar rock coincided with Bolan's more overtly sexual lyrical style and image. Having already begun standing up onstage to perform electric songs, Bolan also incorporated more physical showmanship, such as struts, dances and poses, into his stage act.  The group's new image and sound quickly attracted a new audience much to the despair of the band's early fans. Some of the lyrical content of Tyrannosaurus Rex remained, but the poetic, surrealistic lyrics were now interspersed with sensuous grooves, orgiastic moans and innuendo.|In September 1971, T. Rex released|Electric Warrior|, which featured Currie and Legend. Often considered to be their best album, the chart-topping|Electric Warrior|brought much commercial success to the group;|[7]|publicist|BP Fallon|coined the term \"T. Rextasy\" as a parallel to|Beatlemania|to describe the group's popularity.|[18]|The album included T. Rex's best-known song, \"|Get It On|\", which hit number one in the UK. In January 1972 it became a top ten hit in the US, where the song was retitled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\". The album still recalled Bolan's acoustic roots with ballads such as \"Cosmic Dancer\" and the stark \"Girl\". Soon after, Bolan left|Fly Records|; after his contract had lapsed, the label released the album track \"|Jeepster|\" as a single without his permission. Bolan went to|EMI|, where he was given his own record label in the UK\u2014T. Rex Records, the \"T. Rex Wax Co.\"|[3]|The band released the singles \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" respectively in January and in May 1972, and both became number one hits in the UK.|[7]|In May, Bolan's old label Fly released the chart-topping compilation album|Bolan Boogie|, a collection of singles, B-sides and LP tracks, which affected  sales of the band's forthcoming album. When  it was released in July,|The Slider|peaked at number four in the UK,|[7]|and it became their most successful album in the US, entering the top 20 of the|Billboard|200|.|[19]|The band then released two other standalone singles \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\" which both reached number 2 in the UK. In December, Bolan's own rock film|Born to Boogie|was released  to theatres. The film featured two T. Rex shows at the|Empire Pool, Wembley|, which had been shot by|Ringo Starr|and his crew earlier in the year.|Transition, decline and resurgence (January 1973 \u2013 September 1977)|[|edit|]|Bolan performing on ABC's|In Concert|, 1973|Tanx|was a commercial success, reaching number 3 in the German Albums chart,|[20]|number 4 in the UK,|[7]|and number 5 in Norway.|[20]|An eclectic album containing several melancholy ballads and rich production,|Tanx|showcased the T. Rex sound bolstered by extra instrumental embellishments such as|Mellotron|and saxophone. \"The Street and Babe Shadow\" was|funkier|while the last song \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\" was seen by critics as a nod to|gospel|with several female backing singers.|[21]|Released at the same time in March 1973, the heavy rock \"|20th Century Boy|\" was another important success, peaking at number 3 in the UK Singles chart but was not included in the album.|[7]|\"|The Groover|\" marked the end of the golden era in which T. Rex scored 11 singles in a row in the UK top ten.|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|was released in February 1974, and reached number 12 in the UK. Musically, the band ventured into|blue-eyed soul|and blended rock with funk and|R & B|influences.|[22]|Lyrically, the album harkened back to the Tyrannosaurus Rex days with long song titles and lyrical complexity, but was not a critical success. In the US, Warner Brothers dropped the band without releasing the album. Bill Legend stopped working with Bolan at that time. T. Rex had an extended line-up which included second guitarist|Jack Green|and|B. J. Cole|on pedal steel. Soon after the album's release, Bolan split with producer Visconti, then in December 1974, Finn also left the band. A single, \"|Zip Gun Boogie|\", appeared in late 1974 credited as a Marc Bolan solo effort (though still on the T. Rex label). It only reached UK No. 41, and the T. Rex band identity was quickly re-established.|Bolan's Zip Gun|(1975) saw the group further developing the soul and funk of previous records. Most of the material had already been released the previous year in the US as|Light of Love|. It was self-produced by Bolan who, in addition to writing the songs, gave his music a harder, more futuristic sheen. Bolan's own productions were not well received in the music press. However, in the US,|Rolling Stone|magazine gave it a positive review.|[23]|During this time Bolan became increasingly isolated, while high tax rates in the UK drove him into|exile|in Monte Carlo and the US. No longer a vegetarian, Bolan put on weight due to consumption of hamburgers and alcohol, and was ridiculed in the music press.|T. Rex's penultimate album,|Futuristic Dragon|(1976), featured an inconsistent production style that veered from|Wall of Sound|-style songs to|disco|backing, with nostalgic nods to the old T. Rex boogie machine. It only managed to reach number 50, but the album was better received by the critics and featured the singles \"|New York City|\" (number 15 in the UK) and \"|Dreamy Lady|\" (number 30).|[7]|The latter was promoted as T. Rex Disco Party. To promote the album, the band toured the UK, and performed on television shows such as|Top of the Pops|,|Supersonic|and|Get It Together|.|In the summer of 1976, T. Rex released two more singles, \"|I Love to Boogie|\" (which charted at number 13) and \"|Laser Love|\", which made number 42.|[7]|In early 1977|Dandy in the Underworld|was released to critical acclaim. Bolan had slimmed down and regained his elfin looks, and the songs too had a stripped-down, streamlined sound. A spring UK tour with|punk|band|the Damned|on support garnered positive reviews. As Bolan was enjoying a new surge in popularity, he talked about performing again with Finn and Took, as well as reuniting with Visconti.  A six part|TV series|,|Marc|,|presented|by  Bolan and including multiple performances by T.Rex in each episode as well as other artists, was produced in|Manchester|by|Granada Television|for the|ITV|network.|[24]|Bolan's death, disbandment and reformation attempts|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan and his girlfriend|Gloria Jones|spent the evening of 15 September 1977 drinking at the Speakeasy and then dining at Morton's club on|Berkeley Square|, in|Mayfair|, Central London.|[25]|While driving home early in the morning of 16 September, Jones crashed Bolan's purple|Mini 1275 GT|into a tree (now the site of|Bolan's Rock Shrine|), after failing to navigate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, a few miles from his home at 142 Upper Richmond Road West in|East Sheen|.|[26]|While Jones was severely injured, Bolan was killed in the crash, two weeks before his 30th birthday.|[27]|As Bolan had been the only constant member of T. Rex and also the only composer and writer, his management disbanded the remaining group (keyboardist|Dino Dines|and drummer|Tony Newman|- there was a vacancy for bassist) immediately upon his death. Only Legend survives from the band prior to its commercial decline; Took went on to co-found|Pink Fairies|and appear on|Mick Farren|'s solo album|Mona \u2013 The Carnivorous Circus|before spending the 1970s working mostly on his own material, either solo or fronting bands such as|Shagrat|(1970\u20131971) and|Steve Took's Horns|(1977\u20131978).|[28]|He died in 1980 from asphyxiation caused by choking on a|cocktail cherry|.|[29]|The following year Currie, who had played for|Chris Spedding|before moving to Portugal in 1979, died there in a car crash.|[30]|Finn played as a|session musician|for|the Soup Dragons|and|the Blow Monkeys|before his death in 2003 of possible liver and kidney failure.|[31]|Since Bolan's death there have been two known public attempts by former members to reform the band. These have drawn strong criticism from fans and former associates of Bolan who contend that without a living Bolan, no such band can be an authentic lineup.|[32]|[33]|In 1997 Finn, Green and Legend's successor|Paul Fenton|formed a \"T.Rex\" lineup, soon renamed|Mickey Finn's T-Rex|, with former|Smokie|and|Saxon|members. Following Finn's death in 2003 the band continued on as T. Rex (A Celebration of Marc and Mickey) until a petition signed by Legend, Tony Visconti and David Bowie, among others, forced them to revert their name back to Mickey Finn's T-Rex with his family's blessing.|[32]|[34]|[35]|In 2014 Legend put together his own version of the band, Bill Legend's T. Rex, later known as|X-T. Rex|.|[36]|Influence and legacy|[|edit|]|T. Rex vastly influenced several genres over several decades including|glam rock|, the|punk|movement,|post-punk|,|indie pop|,|britpop|and|alternative rock|. They were cited by acts such as|New York Dolls|,|the Ramones|,|Kate Bush|,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|,|Joy Division|,|R.E.M.|,|the Smiths|,|the Pixies|and|Tricky|.|Sylvain Sylvain|of the New York Dolls said that when forming his band with|Billy Murcia|and|Johnny Thunders|: \"[they]'d all sit on the bed with these cheap guitars and do Marc Bolan songs, as well as some blues and instrumentals\".|[37]|Sparks|were inspired at their beginnings by Tyrannosaurus Rex, before T. Rex:|[38]|seeing them live \"was really our education\" stated|Ron Mael|.|[39]|The Stooges|were inspired by T. Rex when composing and recording the songs of|Raw Power|. Guitarist and songwriter|James Williamson|related: \"We were over in England at the time when Marc Bolan was red hot, and we were looking at his stuff and thinking 'hey, we could be like that,' and writing our stuff and just thinking it would take off.\"|[40]|Joey Ramone|of the Ramones said about Bolan: \"I get into people who are unique and innovative and have colour. That's why I love Marc Bolan. There was something so mystical about him, his singing voice, his manner. His songs really move ya, they're so moving and dark.\"|[41]|Siouxsie and the Banshees performed a cover version of \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career, eventually|releasing it as a B-side|in 1979. Joy Division's|Bernard Sumner|was marked by the sound of the guitar of early T. Rex; his musical journey began at a poppy level with \"Ride a White Swan\".|[42]|The Slits|' guitarist|Viv Albertine|was fascinated by Bolan's guitar playing: \"It was [...] the first time I ever listened to a guitar part. Because back then girls didn't really listen to guitar parts, it was a guy's thing. And guitars were really macho things then and I couldn't bear say, Hendrix's guitar playing, it was too in your face and too threateningly sexual, whereas Marc Bolan's guitar playing was kind of cartoony. And I could sing the parts. They weren't virtuoso, they were funny, they were humourous [|sic|] guitar parts.\"|[43]|Smiths' composer and guitarist|Johnny Marr|stated: \"T. Rex was pure pop\".|[44]|\"The influence of T. Rex is very profound on certain songs of the Smiths like \"|Panic|\" and \"|Shoplifters of the World Unite|\". Lead singer|Morrissey|also admired Bolan. While writing \"Panic\" he was inspired by \"Metal Guru\" and wanted to sing in the same style. He didn't stop singing it in an attempt to modify the words of \"Panic\" to fit the exact rhythm of \"Metal Guru\". Marr later stated: \"He also exhorted me to use the same guitar break so that the two songs are the same!\"|[45]|Marr rated Bolan in his ten favourite guitarists.|[46]|Prefab Sprout|'s|Paddy McAloon|cited \"Ride a White Swan\" as \"the song that vindicated my love of pop\".|[47]|R.E.M. covered live \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career in 1984:|[48]|singer|Michael Stipe|said that T. Rex and other groups of the 1970s \"were huge influences on all of us\",|[49]|\"[they] really impacted me\".|[50]|The Pixies's lead guitarist|Joey Santiago|cited|Electric Warrior|in his 13 defining records,|[51]|as did|the Jam|'s|Paul Weller|.|[52]|Santiago said: \"Bolan took the blues and made it a lot more palatable\".|[51]|Kate Bush listened to Bolan during her teenage years and then mentioned his name in the lyrics of the song \"Blow Away (for Bill)\".|[53]|Nick Cave|covered live \"Cosmic Dancer\",|[54]|commenting that|Electric Warrior|contained \"some of the greatest lyrics ever written\",|[55]|further adding, it was \"my favorite record, [...] the songs are so beautiful, it is an extraordinary record\".|[56]|Tricky cited Bolan as \"totally unique and ahead of his time\".|[57]|When talking about his favourite albums,|PJ Harvey|'s collaborator|John Parish|said that T. Rex \"is the place to start\", adding that \"this band and that album [|Electric Warrior|] was what got me into music in the first place\". When he saw T. Rex on Top of the Pops playing \"Jeepster\", he felt: \"that's my kind of music [...] The thing I related to as 12-year-old I still go back to and uses as one of my main touchstones when I'm making records\".|[58]|Parish explained, \"I've been listening to T.Rex pretty consistently since 1971\".|[59]|Oasis|\"borrowed\" the distinct guitar riff from \"Get It On\" on their single \"|Cigarettes & Alcohol|\".|[60]|Oasis's guitarist,|Noel Gallagher|, has cited T. Rex as a strong influence.|[61]|The early acoustic material was influential in helping to bring about|progressive rock|and 21st century|folk music|-influenced singers as|Devendra Banhart|,|[62]|who said: \"I love Tyrannosaurus Rex so much, it's so easy to love, so righteous to love, and so natural to love, I can't imagine anyone not liking it.\"|[63]|T. Rex are referenced in several popular songs, including|David Bowie|'s \"|All the Young Dudes|\" (which he wrote for|Mott the Hoople|in 1972),|[64]|the Ramones' \"|Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?|\",|[65]|Serge Gainsbourg|'s \"Ex-Fan Des Sixties\",|[66]|the Who|'s \"|You Better You Bet|\",|[67]|B A Robertson|'s \"Kool in the Kaftan\",|[68]|R.E.M.'s \"The Wake-Up Bomb\",|[69]|My Chemical Romance|'s \"Vampire Money\",|[70]|and|Panic! at the Disco|'s \"Middle of a Breakup\".|[71]|The music of T. Rex features in the soundtracks of various movies, including|Velvet Goldmine|,|[72]|Death Proof|,|[73]|Billy Elliot|,|[74]|the Bank Job|,|[75]|Dallas Buyers Club|,|[76]|and|Baby Driver|.|[77]|The sleeve of|The Slider|album can be seen in the|Lindsay Anderson|movie|O Lucky Man!|,|[78]|and in|Tim Burton|'s|Dark Shadows|.|[79]|In|Miha Mazzini|'s novel|King of the Rattling Spirits|, the narrator starts remembering his childhood when he sees Tyrannosaurus Rex record \"King of Rumbling Spires\" in the record store and realizes he has mistakenly remembered the title as \"King of the Rattling Spirits\".|[80]|Discography|[|edit|]|Main article:|T.

          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",

          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",
          "|edit|]|Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967, following a handful of failed solo singles and a brief career as lead guitarist in psych-rock band|John's Children|. After a solitary disastrous performance as a four-piece electric rock band on 22 July at the Electric Garden in London's|Covent Garden|alongside drummer Steve Porter plus two older musicians: guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bassist, the group immediately broke up.|[2]|[3]|Subsequently, Bolan retained the band name and the services of Porter, who switched to percussion under the name Steve Peregrin Took, and the two began performing acoustic material as a duo with a repertoire of folk-influenced Bolan-penned songs. Inspired by an influential performance by|Ravi Shankar|whom Bolan had seen while touring West Germany with John's Children, the band adopted a stage manner resembling the performance of traditional Indian music.|[3]|[4]|The combination of Bolan's|acoustic guitar|and distinctive vocal style with Took's|bongos|and assorted percussion\u2014which often included children's instruments such as the|Pixiphone|\u2014earned them a devoted following in the thriving|hippy|underground scene.|BBC Radio One|Disc jockey|John Peel|championed the band early in their recording career.|[5]|Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer|Tony Visconti|, who went on to produce the band's albums well into their second,|glam rock|phase.|[6]|Their debut album|My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair...|remained in the|UK Albums chart|for nine weeks and peaked at number 15.|[7]|Their second album|Prophets, Seers & Sages|was released a few months later.|During 1968\u20131969, Tyrannosaurus Rex had become a modest success on radio and on record. Their third single \"Pewter Suitor\", released in January 1969, failed to chart but their third album|Unicorn|came within striking distance of the|UK Top 10 Albums|.|[7]|While Bolan's early solo material was|rock and roll|-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and|baroque|songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with|Greek|and|Persian mythology|as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.|[8]|Their fourth single \"King of the Rumbling Spires\" issued in July, was a musical departure compared to the previous material: they used a full rock band setup with a drumkit and an entirely electric sound.  However, by mid-1969 there was a rift developing between the two halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Bolan working on his book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|and concentrating on his songs and performance skills. Took, however, had fully embraced the anti-commercial,|drug|-taking ethos of the|UK Underground|scene centred around|Ladbroke Grove|. Took was also attracted to anarchic elements such as|Mick Farren|/|Deviants|and members of the|Pink Fairies|Rock 'n' Roll and Drinking Club.|[9]|Took also began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his bandmate's efforts, rejecting them for the duo's putative fourth album, in production in Spring/Summer 1969. In response to Bolan's rebuff, Took contributed two songs as well as vocals and percussion to|Twink|'s|Think Pink|album.|[10]|Behind the scenes, Bolan's relationship with Took ended after this dispute, although they were contractually obliged to go through with a US tour which was doomed before it began. Poorly promoted and planned, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, Took drew from the|shock rock|style of|Iggy Pop|; Took explained, \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of|Los Angeles|shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"|[11]|Bolan returned to the UK in September and advertised for a replacement for Took. A month later he recruited percussionist|Mickey Finn|.|[6]|and they completed the fourth album, released in early 1970 as|A Beard of Stars|, the final album under the Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. This line up headlined the very first|Glastonbury Festival|in 1970.|[12]|As well as progressively shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums began to show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound.|[13]|Glam rock and commercial success (July 1970 \u2013 December 1972)|[|edit|]|Bolan continued the process of simplification by shortening the band's name to T. Rex.|[14]|The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, \"|Ride a White Swan|\" recorded in July and released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and would soon reach number 2.|[7]|Ticket fees were reduced to 10 shillings/50p to attract a younger audience.|[15]|The eponymous first|T. Rex|album, also recorded that summer, was released in December and continued the move to electric guitars.|[13]|In early 1971,|T. Rex|reached the top 20 of the official|UK Albums Chart|.|[14]|During the February\u2013April 1971 suspension of the official album chart (caused by|a national postal strike|) a chart by|Melody Maker|\u2014which the|Official Chart Company|'s website nowadays recognises as canonical for the gap period\u2014listed the LP as having peaked at number 7.|[16]|[17]|\"Ride a White Swan\" was quickly followed by a second single, \"|Hot Love|\", which reached the top spot on the UK charts, and remained there for six weeks.|[7]|Between these two releases, Bolan first recruited bassist|Steve Currie|, and then drummer|Bill Legend|, to form a full band to record and tour to growing audiences.  After Chelita Secunda added two spots of glitter under Bolan's eyes before an appearance on|Top of the Pops|for which Bolan wore shiny satin trousers and a shiny jacket (from Chelsea boutique Alkasura) in place of his previous hippy clothes, soon followed by another appearance for the show on which he wore a silver velvet/satin sailor suit, the ensuing performances would often be viewed as the birth of glam rock.|After Bolan's displays, glam rock would gain popularity in the UK and Europe during 1971\u20131972. The completion of T. Rex's move to electric guitar rock coincided with Bolan's more overtly sexual lyrical style and image. Having already begun standing up onstage to perform electric songs, Bolan also incorporated more physical showmanship, such as struts, dances and poses, into his stage act.  The group's new image and sound quickly attracted a new audience much to the despair of the band's early fans. Some of the lyrical content of Tyrannosaurus Rex remained, but the poetic, surrealistic lyrics were now interspersed with sensuous grooves, orgiastic moans and innuendo.|In September 1971, T. Rex released|Electric Warrior|, which featured Currie and Legend. Often considered to be their best album, the chart-topping|Electric Warrior|brought much commercial success to the group;|[7]|publicist|BP Fallon|coined the term \"T. Rextasy\" as a parallel to|Beatlemania|to describe the group's popularity.|[18]|The album included T. Rex's best-known song, \"|Get It On|\", which hit number one in the UK. In January 1972 it became a top ten hit in the US, where the song was retitled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\". The album still recalled Bolan's acoustic roots with ballads such as \"Cosmic Dancer\" and the stark \"Girl\". Soon after, Bolan left|Fly Records|; after his contract had lapsed, the label released the album track \"|Jeepster|\" as a single without his permission. Bolan went to|EMI|, where he was given his own record label in the UK\u2014T. Rex Records, the \"T. Rex Wax Co.\"|[3]|The band released the singles \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" respectively in January and in May 1972, and both became number one hits in the UK.|[7]|In May, Bolan's old label Fly released the chart-topping compilation album|Bolan Boogie|, a collection of singles, B-sides and LP tracks, which affected  sales of the band's forthcoming album. When  it was released in July,|The Slider|peaked at number four in the UK,|[7]|and it became their most successful album in the US, entering the top 20 of the|Billboard|200|.|[19]|The band then released two other standalone singles \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\" which both reached number 2 in the UK. In December, Bolan's own rock film|Born to Boogie|was released  to theatres. The film featured two T. Rex shows at the|Empire Pool, Wembley|, which had been shot by|Ringo Starr|and his crew earlier in the year.|Transition, decline and resurgence (January 1973 \u2013 September 1977)|[|edit|]|Bolan performing on ABC's|In Concert|, 1973|Tanx|was a commercial success, reaching number 3 in the German Albums chart,|[20]|number 4 in the UK,|[7]|and number 5 in Norway.|[20]|An eclectic album containing several melancholy ballads and rich production,|Tanx|showcased the T. Rex sound bolstered by extra instrumental embellishments such as|Mellotron|and saxophone. \"The Street and Babe Shadow\" was|funkier|while the last song \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\" was seen by critics as a nod to|gospel|with several female backing singers.|[21]|Released at the same time in March 1973, the heavy rock \"|20th Century Boy|\" was another important success, peaking at number 3 in the UK Singles chart but was not included in the album.|[7]|\"|The Groover|\" marked the end of the golden era in which T. Rex scored 11 singles in a row in the UK top ten.|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|was released in February 1974, and reached number 12 in the UK. Musically, the band ventured into|blue-eyed soul|and blended rock with funk and|R & B|influences.|[22]|Lyrically, the album harkened back to the Tyrannosaurus Rex days with long song titles and lyrical complexity, but was not a critical success. In the US, Warner Brothers dropped the band without releasing the album. Bill Legend stopped working with Bolan at that time. T. Rex had an extended line-up which included second guitarist|Jack Green|and|B. J. Cole|on pedal steel. Soon after the album's release, Bolan split with producer Visconti, then in December 1974, Finn also left the band. A single, \"|Zip Gun Boogie|\", appeared in late 1974 credited as a Marc Bolan solo effort (though still on the T. Rex label). It only reached UK No. 41, and the T. Rex band identity was quickly re-established.|Bolan's Zip Gun|(1975) saw the group further developing the soul and funk of previous records. Most of the material had already been released the previous year in the US as|Light of Love|. It was self-produced by Bolan who, in addition to writing the songs, gave his music a harder, more futuristic sheen. Bolan's own productions were not well received in the music press. However, in the US,|Rolling Stone|magazine gave it a positive review.|[23]|During this time Bolan became increasingly isolated, while high tax rates in the UK drove him into|exile|in Monte Carlo and the US. No longer a vegetarian, Bolan put on weight due to consumption of hamburgers and alcohol, and was ridiculed in the music press.|T. Rex's penultimate album,|Futuristic Dragon|(1976), featured an inconsistent production style that veered from|Wall of Sound|-style songs to|disco|backing, with nostalgic nods to the old T. Rex boogie machine. It only managed to reach number 50, but the album was better received by the critics and featured the singles \"|New York City|\" (number 15 in the UK) and \"|Dreamy Lady|\" (number 30).|[7]|The latter was promoted as T. Rex Disco Party. To promote the album, the band toured the UK, and performed on television shows such as|Top of the Pops|,|Supersonic|and|Get It Together|.|In the summer of 1976, T. Rex released two more singles, \"|I Love to Boogie|\" (which charted at number 13) and \"|Laser Love|\", which made number 42.|[7]|In early 1977|Dandy in the Underworld|was released to critical acclaim. Bolan had slimmed down and regained his elfin looks, and the songs too had a stripped-down, streamlined sound. A spring UK tour with|punk|band|the Damned|on support garnered positive reviews. As Bolan was enjoying a new surge in popularity, he talked about performing again with Finn and Took, as well as reuniting with Visconti.  A six part|TV series|,|Marc|,|presented|by  Bolan and including multiple performances by T.Rex in each episode as well as other artists, was produced in|Manchester|by|Granada Television|for the|ITV|network.|[24]|Bolan's death, disbandment and reformation attempts|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan and his girlfriend|Gloria Jones|spent the evening of 15 September 1977 drinking at the Speakeasy and then dining at Morton's club on|Berkeley Square|, in|Mayfair|, Central London.|[25]|While driving home early in the morning of 16 September, Jones crashed Bolan's purple|Mini 1275 GT|into a tree (now the site of|Bolan's Rock Shrine|), after failing to navigate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, a few miles from his home at 142 Upper Richmond Road West in|East Sheen|.|[26]|While Jones was severely injured, Bolan was killed in the crash, two weeks before his 30th birthday.|[27]|As Bolan had been the only constant member of T. Rex and also the only composer and writer, his management disbanded the remaining group (keyboardist|Dino Dines|and drummer|Tony Newman|- there was a vacancy for bassist) immediately upon his death. Only Legend survives from the band prior to its commercial decline; Took went on to co-found|Pink Fairies|and appear on|Mick Farren|'s solo album|Mona \u2013 The Carnivorous Circus|before spending the 1970s working mostly on his own material, either solo or fronting bands such as|Shagrat|(1970\u20131971) and|Steve Took's Horns|(1977\u20131978).|[28]|He died in 1980 from asphyxiation caused by choking on a|cocktail cherry|.|[29]|The following year Currie, who had played for|Chris Spedding|before moving to Portugal in 1979, died there in a car crash.|[30]|Finn played as a|session musician|for|the Soup Dragons|and|the Blow Monkeys|before his death in 2003 of possible liver and kidney failure.|[31]|Since Bolan's death there have been two known public attempts by former members to reform the band. These have drawn strong criticism from fans and former associates of Bolan who contend that without a living Bolan, no such band can be an authentic lineup.|[32]|[33]|In 1997 Finn, Green and Legend's successor|Paul Fenton|formed a \"T.Rex\" lineup, soon renamed|Mickey Finn's T-Rex|, with former|Smokie|and|Saxon|members. Following Finn's death in 2003 the band continued on as T. Rex (A Celebration of Marc and Mickey) until a petition signed by Legend, Tony Visconti and David Bowie, among others, forced them to revert their name back to Mickey Finn's T-Rex with his family's blessing.|[32]|[34]|[35]|In 2014 Legend put together his own version of the band, Bill Legend's T. Rex, later known as|X-T. Rex|.|[36]|Influence and legacy|[|edit|]|T. Rex vastly influenced several genres over several decades including|glam rock|, the|punk|movement,|post-punk|,|indie pop|,|britpop|and|alternative rock|. They were cited by acts such as|New York Dolls|,|the Ramones|,|Kate Bush|,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|,|Joy Division|,|R.E.M.|,|the Smiths|,|the Pixies|and|Tricky|.|Sylvain Sylvain|of the New York Dolls said that when forming his band with|Billy Murcia|and|Johnny Thunders|: \"[they]'d all sit on the bed with these cheap guitars and do Marc Bolan songs, as well as some blues and instrumentals\".|[37]|Sparks|were inspired at their beginnings by Tyrannosaurus Rex, before T. Rex:|[38]|seeing them live \"was really our education\" stated|Ron Mael|.|[39]|The Stooges|were inspired by T. Rex when composing and recording the songs of|Raw Power|. Guitarist and songwriter|James Williamson|related: \"We were over in England at the time when Marc Bolan was red hot, and we were looking at his stuff and thinking 'hey, we could be like that,' and writing our stuff and just thinking it would take off.\"|[40]|Joey Ramone|of the Ramones said about Bolan: \"I get into people who are unique and innovative and have colour. That's why I love Marc Bolan. There was something so mystical about him, his singing voice, his manner. His songs really move ya, they're so moving and dark.\"|[41]|Siouxsie and the Banshees performed a cover version of \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career, eventually|releasing it as a B-side|in 1979. Joy Division's|Bernard Sumner|was marked by the sound of the guitar of early T. Rex; his musical journey began at a poppy level with \"Ride a White Swan\".|[42]|The Slits|' guitarist|Viv Albertine|was fascinated by Bolan's guitar playing: \"It was [...] the first time I ever listened to a guitar part. Because back then girls didn't really listen to guitar parts, it was a guy's thing. And guitars were really macho things then and I couldn't bear say, Hendrix's guitar playing, it was too in your face and too threateningly sexual, whereas Marc Bolan's guitar playing was kind of cartoony. And I could sing the parts. They weren't virtuoso, they were funny, they were humourous [|sic|] guitar parts.\"|[43]|Smiths' composer and guitarist|Johnny Marr|stated: \"T. Rex was pure pop\".|[44]|\"The influence of T. Rex is very profound on certain songs of the Smiths like \"|Panic|\" and \"|Shoplifters of the World Unite|\". Lead singer|Morrissey|also admired Bolan. While writing \"Panic\" he was inspired by \"Metal Guru\" and wanted to sing in the same style. He didn't stop singing it in an attempt to modify the words of \"Panic\" to fit the exact rhythm of \"Metal Guru\". Marr later stated: \"He also exhorted me to use the same guitar break so that the two songs are the same!\"|[45]|Marr rated Bolan in his ten favourite guitarists.|[46]|Prefab Sprout|'s|Paddy McAloon|cited \"Ride a White Swan\" as \"the song that vindicated my love of pop\".|[47]|R.E.M. covered live \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career in 1984:|[48]|singer|Michael Stipe|said that T. Rex and other groups of the 1970s \"were huge influences on all of us\",|[49]|\"[they] really impacted me\".|[50]|The Pixies's lead guitarist|Joey Santiago|cited|Electric Warrior|in his 13 defining records,|[51]|as did|the Jam|'s|Paul Weller|.|[52]|Santiago said: \"Bolan took the blues and made it a lot more palatable\".|[51]|Kate Bush listened to Bolan during her teenage years and then mentioned his name in the lyrics of the song \"Blow Away (for Bill)\".|[53]|Nick Cave|covered live \"Cosmic Dancer\",|[54]|commenting that|Electric Warrior|contained \"some of the greatest lyrics ever written\",|[55]|further adding, it was \"my favorite record, [...] the songs are so beautiful, it is an extraordinary record\".|[56]|Tricky cited Bolan as \"totally unique and ahead of his time\".|[57]|When talking about his favourite albums,|PJ Harvey|'s collaborator|John Parish|said that T. Rex \"is the place to start\", adding that \"this band and that album [|Electric Warrior|] was what got me into music in the first place\". When he saw T. Rex on Top of the Pops playing \"Jeepster\", he felt: \"that's my kind of music [...] The thing I related to as 12-year-old I still go back to and uses as one of my main touchstones when I'm making records\".|[58]|Parish explained, \"I've been listening to T.Rex pretty consistently since 1971\".|[59]|Oasis|\"borrowed\" the distinct guitar riff from \"Get It On\" on their single \"|Cigarettes & Alcohol|\".|[60]|Oasis's guitarist,|Noel Gallagher|, has cited T. Rex as a strong influence.|[61]|The early acoustic material was influential in helping to bring about|progressive rock|and 21st century|folk music|-influenced singers as|Devendra Banhart|,|[62]|who said: \"I love Tyrannosaurus Rex so much, it's so easy to love, so righteous to love, and so natural to love, I can't imagine anyone not liking it.\"|[63]|T. Rex are referenced in several popular songs, including|David Bowie|'s \"|All the Young Dudes|\" (which he wrote for|Mott the Hoople|in 1972),|[64]|the Ramones' \"|Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?|\",|[65]|Serge Gainsbourg|'s \"Ex-Fan Des Sixties\",|[66]|the Who|'s \"|You Better You Bet|\",|[67]|B A Robertson|'s \"Kool in the Kaftan\",|[68]|R.E.M.'s \"The Wake-Up Bomb\",|[69]|My Chemical Romance|'s \"Vampire Money\",|[70]|and|Panic! at the Disco|'s \"Middle of a Breakup\".|[71]|The music of T. Rex features in the soundtracks of various movies, including|Velvet Goldmine|,|[72]|Death Proof|,|[73]|Billy Elliot|,|[74]|the Bank Job|,|[75]|Dallas Buyers Club|,|[76]|and|Baby Driver|.|[77]|The sleeve of|The Slider|album can be seen in the|Lindsay Anderson|movie|O Lucky Man!|,|[78]|and in|Tim Burton|'s|Dark Shadows|.|[79]|In|Miha Mazzini|'s novel|King of the Rattling Spirits|, the narrator starts remembering his childhood when he sees Tyrannosaurus Rex record \"King of Rumbling Spires\" in the record store and realizes he has mistakenly remembered the title as \"King of the Rattling Spirits\".|[80]|Discography|[|edit|]|Main article:|T.

          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",

          "|\"When you think back to the early 70s, you had Val Doonican in the charts, the Beatles were still in the charts around that time.|\"And then you had this guy with glitter on his face, androgynously dressed, it was the start of glam rock, he created that whole thing.\"|Tony, who grew up in Wolverhampton before later moving to Shifnal, was so captivated with Bolan and his story, that he wrote a book called The Wizard's Gown chronicling his remarkable life story.|Bolan was born Mark Feld in 1947, to a working-class family in Hackney, east London. His mother Phyllis was Christian, but his father Simeon was a Jew with Russian and Polish ancestry, and Mark was named after his uncle Private Mark Feld, who had been beaten to death by an anti-Semitic fellow soldier the previous year.|Marc Bolan is pictured appearing with Tyrannosaurus Rex at Frank Freeman's in Kidderminster|At the age of nine he formed his own skiffle band, and while at school with Helen Shapiro he played the guitar in her trio \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\". A school friend remembered him turning him up at school in tears the day Buddy Holly died, only to be told by a teacher that Holly would be forgotten within a decade.|After leaving school, he worked briefly as a model, posing in suits for the menswear chain John Temple, and he also appeared as an extra in the television series Orlando, where he was dressed as a mod. But music remained his first great love, and after handful of failed solo singles, and a brief spell as the lead guitarist of psychedelic rock band John's Children, he formed Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967.|The band did not enjoy the happiest of starts. Bolan \u2013 his adopted stage name was reputedly a contraction of that of his hero, Bob Dylan \u2013 booked the Electric Garden at London's Covent Garden on July 22, 1967, before he had finalised line-up. Legend has it that he was still holding auditions on the day of the show, and by all reports the band's debut performance was a disaster. Originally a four-piece electric band made up of Bolan, drummer Steve Porter who would take the name Steve Peregrin Took, guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bass player, the bandmates barely knew one another and had little chance to practice. The performance was panned by pretty much everybody who witnessed it, and it was little surprise that it would never perform again in that format. Undeterred, Bolan reinvented Tyrannosaurus Rex as a two-piece acoustic band featuring just himself and Took. Bolan's eccentric lyrics and eastern-influenced melodies, coupled with Took's use of unusual percussion instruments, earned the band a loyal following on London's emerging hippie scene, and in its early days it was championed by Radio 1 DJ and former Shrewsbury schoolboy John Peel.|Marc Bolan|By 1969, a rift had developed between Bolan and Took. While Bolan was now living a quiet life with girlfriend June Child, and had just written his book of poetry, Took had fully embraced himself in the anti-establishment, drug-taking UK Underground scene in Ladbroke Grove, north London. The pair parted company, and Took's place was taken by new percussionist Mickey Fynn, and the new-look band began to move towards electric rather than acoustic instruments. In 1970, the band shortened its name to T Rex \u2013 reputedly after manager Tony Visconti became bored with writing the name out in full and began abbreviating it.|The snappy new title was used for the band's break-out single Ride A White Swan, as Bolan embraced a more pop-orientated, light-hearted style. Out went the introspective folk style music, which was going out of fashion anyway, and in came catchy electric tunes and flamboyant outfits, which included top hats, glitter, and stars stuck on his face. It is said that he got the idea for the glitter after seeing his then wife June wearing it.|As the glam-rock era dawned, Bolan and T Rex entered the musical stratosphere, selling 40 million records by the time of his death in 1977. But behind the screaming fans, all was not well for the singer, who descended into a drug and alcohol addiction, as well as the break-up of his marriage.|\"I got involved with drugs, particularly cocaine, and I started to drink a lot. I just didn\u2019t particularly want to be a rock star any more,\" he said.|\"I was living in a twilight world of drugs, booze and kinky sex. Before I crashed out of the pop scene I was drinking myself to death.\"|Ironically, by the time of his death, Bolan had begun to get his life on track.|\"He had stopped the drinking and the drugs, and had begun going for runs to get himself into shape and look after his body,\" says Tony Stringfellow, who now keeps an art studio in Barmouth called The Paper Swan in tribute to his hero.|Tony, who is painting a picture of Bolan to mark the anniversary, says while people remember T Rex for hit pop singles such as Get It On, I Love To Boogie, and Hot Love, he says it is the albums, with their insightful, fantasy-based lyrics that really show the genius of Bolan.|\"A lot of people criticised Bolan for writing nonsensical lyrics, but many of these were written allegorically,\" he says.|\"Instead of writing about a director who did the dirty on him, for example, he would say it was a wizard doing the dirty. The singles were written for the pop market, but the albums were a lot deeper.\"|*The Wizard's Gown by Tony Stringfellow is available on Amazon.|News|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Most Read|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|'Rare opportunity' to take on well-established Shropshire garden centre|Premium|Business|||19 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|Top Stories|Dad accuses police of inaction after horrific video emerges on social media of boy, 13, being kicked in the face|Premium|Shrewsbury|||2 hours ago|Village Co-op closed after break-in|Shrewsbury|||Just now|Convicted sex offender who lied to children's football team about past is jailed|Shrewsbury|||4 hours ago|\u00a33,500 Telford booze thief stole champagne, beer and vodka from supermarkets in four-month crime spree|Premium|Telford|||4 hours ago|Anger as horse riding instructor allowed to keep job after swearing at child|Premium|Shifnal|||4 hours ago|Firefighters deal with grass fire near Telford primary school after hours|Dawley|||Just now|Fire service and police called out to Telford house fire incident|Telford|||Just now|How many Shropshire students go to top-rated schools, according to latest figures?|Premium|Education|||4 hours ago|Man who assaulted woman in Telford ordered to do unpaid work|Telford|||4 hours ago|Fire service called out to late-night car fire on A458 near Bridgnorth|Much Wenlock|||Just now|Council pledges to 'work closely' over Environment Agency's relief road concerns|Shrewsbury|||Just now|'We are not sufficiently reassured!'

          "|In the late 60's his wife June was insistent that Marc never took drugs. He'd hold a 'joint' if offered one, to appear 'in' but then pass it on without inhaling. One of the reasons Marc said he'd been unable to work with Steve Took was Took's drug taking. However, by 1973 Marc was consuming large amounts of cocaine. For a natural egotistic like Marc, cocaine is probably THE worst drug to take. He was also beginning to surround himself with 'yes men' and with an urge to mix his own musical style with that of his girlfriend, (US Black Soul) his judgement was impaired and the music slid.|1974 - Cutting off those who helped him and more T.Rex personell changes|Marc and producer Tony Visconti went their separate ways in March of 1974. Citing \"Musical Differences\" as the reason, this split ended a 6 year, nine album partnership that had taken Marc Bolan from nowhere to the top of the British Rock scene. However, the differences weren't 'musical' but rather 'financial'. Marc cut the percentage paid to Tony Visconti in half and it was this that caused Visconti and Marc to part company. There are often many debates on who was the better producer: Tony Visconti or Marc Bolan. Even some loyal fans have to admit Visconti had the edge. This was just one of the decisions Marc made which was clearly a mistake. To insult Visconti after so many years together by penny pinching and by wanting to take control of every aspect of your music rather than trusting to the experts is seen by many as a serious mistake by Bolan. T.Rex was headed for the lowest point in its existence. Marc brought Dino Dines in on keyboard. Two drummers was deemed to be too many so Marc kept on Davey Lutton which Gloria Jones was given the job of playing Clavinet in addition to continuing on backing vocals.|1974 - The London Boy - A Tax Exile and 'Porky Pixie'|The albums produced after Visconti's departure did not have the  same 'spark' as in Marc's peak years of late 1970 to early 1973. This was due to three things: 1) Visconti's absence; 2) Marc's drive to push his music where his audience didn't want it to go and 3) Due to drink and drug induced dulled senses and clouded judgement. Due to a greatly reduced, but very loyal fan base, he did manage to maintain enough of an audience to score one more UK Top 20 hit per year until 1977. Many records entering the charts in their week of release only to disappear the following week. This is a sure sign that a 'hard core' group of fans are buying them, rather than the general public and this was true to single 'Light of Love' (released in July 1974) which barely entered the charts. The next album, Bolan's Zip Gun' and another single 'Zip Gun Boogie' were released. The single didn't even reach into the top thirty and the album likewise flopped commercially.|1974/5 - The Loss of Mickey Finn from 'Marc n' Mickey'|By the close of 1974 (and certainly by the time Marc went into the studios at the end of January 1975) Mickey Finn left in the band. The second bongo player to be sacked by Marc. Marc was on his own, apart from Gloria, the drink, drugs, and junk food, living in various foreign countries. A London Boy very far from home.|1975 - Gloria finds out she's pregnant and Marc almost Dies!|Towards the beginning of 1975 Gloria discovered she was pregnant. \"I'm going to live like a sane human being because I intend to be around for a long time yet,\" he declared shortly before Marc collapsed after a week of heavy drinking. He was told by the doctors that he had been very lucky and, without some serious rest and restructuring of his lifestyle, he might well die. Marc decided, to return to his roots and his homeland. Despite the heavy tax burden, Marc realized that his destiny was not in America and it was time to come home. Gloria and Marc rented a reasonable sized town house in Fulham. In June 1975, Marc released a new single. 'New York City'. It reached #15, which although not a #1 showed people that T.Rex was still around. The song used a riff from 'One Inch Rock', and many people at the time were please to hear the 'original T.Rex sound' seemed to be back.|1975 - Marc becomes a dad.|In September 1975 the single 'Dreamy Lady' was released.  Although it charted, it didn't get as high as 'New York City'. But for Marc the biggest event in September was the birth of his son; Rolan Seymour Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld').  Marc claimed to have delivered Rolan himself. \"This baby's made all the difference to my life,\" he said, \"The most important thing is that he has given me a sense of responsibility. Whenever I feel myself getting silly and maybe thinking of slipping into my old ways I just imagine myself dying and Rolan never really having known me. That's a horrible thought.\"|1975 - Marc The Chat Show Host|Marc was invited in for an interview on the Thame Television British 'Today' show with host Telly Savalas. During the interview, Marc literally took over the interview and began asking more questions of Telly Savalas than vice-versa. As a result, Thames Television contracted Marc to work for them as an interviewer. Among the people Marc interviewed were Angie Bowie, Keith Moon, John Mayall, and Stan Lee the creator of the Marvel Comic characters. Marc found this new career to be quite enjoyable but promised not to become another David Frost. He also used the opportunity to introduce two new songs on the show - \"London Boys\" and \"Funky London Childhood\". Marc showed a natural ability. With his charismatic smile, and quick wit he was able to put guests at their ease and produce a programme which was enjoyable to watch. This is certainly an area of the entertainment industry in which he could have excelled as he grew older.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Album|In February the 'Futuristic Dragon' album was released along with the single 'London Boys'.  On the front of this album was a painting of Marc painted by George Underwood, an artist who's association with Marc started when he drew Tyrannosaurus Rex's first album cover in 1968. The album began with Marc reciting a brief poem about the 'Dragon' as an electric guitar shrilled with feedback in the background. Much of the album was recorded in 1974.|1976 - 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour|To promote the album Bolan toured the UK. However, many reviewers were critical of the Marc Bolan they saw perform in stage. Despite claims by Marc that he had given up drink and drugs and that people would see a clean-living Bolan it certainly wasn't happening during the 'Futuristic Dragon' Tour. The over-weight Bolan looked in poor health. During the tour he was often drunk and frequently belligerent to those he worked with. During performances he forgot lyrics and took his frustrations out by reproaching and berating his audiences.|\"His world wasn't that real.\"|Allan Jones attended the Lyceum Ballroom, London gig and wrote in '|Melody Maker'|, \"It was the saddest spectacle I'd witnessed in years.\" In interviews however, Marc produced various excuses for the poor attendance at many of the concerts. He also preferred to talk of the 'big' projects he had lined up including producing Gloria and Richard Jones records, his as-yet-to-be-released book of poetry, '|Wilderness of the mind|', and plans for the big 'masterwork'|Billy Super Duper|. As 1976 progressed Bolan would also announce that he and David Bowie were working on a film script and \"need two million to make the film\". Like the film Bolan had earlier claimed to have been appearing in along with David Niven the Bowie/Bolan film Collaboration didn't materialise. One of his oldest friends, Jeff Dexter recalled of that time, \"Marc was never a has-been in his own eyes. He didn't hear other people. His world wasn't that real.\"|1976 - 'I Love to Boogie' - 'Teenage Boogie'|Marc felt that 'Futuristic Dragon' was still too pop. He wanted to get back more to basic rock and listened to a number of old Rock 'n' Roll albums trying to get that old sound back into his head. What resulted was a new single called 'I Love to Boogie' (released in June of 1976). It was slammed by the press for sounding all too much like the 1956 song 'Teenage Boogie' and a club of Oldies fans even held a record burning to display their disgust. But the public liked it and it reached #13 on the UK charts. It would however, be the last Top Twenty chart hit Marc would ever produce.|1976 - July -|Supersonic - Rollin' Bolan|After the Top Twenty success of 'I Love to Boogie' Marc was approached to make a TV 'Special' and in July recorded five songs for the show which aired the following month as|'Rollin' Bolan'|.|1976 - The final 'Original' band member leaves|The|'Rollin' Bolan'|performance was the last to feature two T.Rex members; Davey Lutton who joined in 1974 and Original member Steve Currie, who joined Marc n' Mickey in 1970. Lutton was sacked and Currie quit; burnt-out from six years in T-Rex. Now all of the original members of T-Rex had gone.|1976 - Diet and New Album underway|Marc replaced Jack Green as second guitarist with Miller Anderson. He brought in session men Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums while Dino Dines stayed on keyboards. For a time Steve Currie worked with Marc, but he only appears on few of the new songs. Gloria, busy with her own career and made only a few appearances on the new album. Marc tried to reduce his drinking went on a diet to loose all of the excess weight he had put on during his exile, although the 'Futuristic Dragon Tour showed that certainly during the early part of the year this was more talk than action. Marc's writing was often autobiographical. Marc had risen from the bottom to the top and then fell back to the bottom and using an Americanism to describe it, Marc penned  'Life's an Elevator'\" which was released on the 'b' side of 'Laser Love' in the same month as Marc and Gloria moved into Upper Richmond Road.|1976 - September - 142 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen|Marc and Gloria moved home to England and bought a house in Upper Richmond Road West, only around a mile from Marc's parents' home at 9 Inglis House, Whitnell Way, Putney. When Rolan's mum and dad were away, he would stop at his Feld grandparents home. Marc had been to the bottom, much of his wealth had gone, but he managed to lose weight. Building work still continued in the house so they were still reduced to living in a couple of rooms with much of their possessions in storage. According to Mark Paytress, \"the property, with high ceilings and wooden floors, never really acquired any traditional sense of domesticity. Marc would often conduct his business lying on his large bed, surrounded by racks of stage clothes and unpacked boxes, as bemused workmen continued their renovations around him\".|1976 - Gloria Jones' 'Vixen' Album|Gloria worked on her own music during 1976 which culminated on 'Vixen' released in December 1976. Not only did Bolan produce the album for her, he wrote several songs and played guitar on many tracks.|1977 - Godfather of Punk?|Things were rapidly changing in the British music industry in the form of Punk. \"I'm the originator of punk rock. In America I was always billed as the Cosmic Punk.\" he declared. A number of the emerging punk artists had gone through their teenage years listening to T.Rex music and acknowledged Marc's influence on their music, so that Marc was able to pull back some credibility by befriending The Damned and positioning himself as the 'Godfather of punk'. It should be noted that although some punk bands would agree with this 'Godfather of punk' tag, at least as many scoff at the suggestion of Marc being 'punk' in any real sense other than a superficial ripped T-shirt, citing the fact that his last single, \"Celebrate Summer\" released in 1977 showed little sign of 'punk'.|1977 - Tour, Album and Four Singles|In March 1977 set out on a tour to promote his new album 'Dandy in the Underworld' , taking along the Damned as support, cleverly guaranteeing that a young audience who did not remember his heyday would come along to the gigs. Of the Damned, Marc commented that|\"I was introduced to them because one of them had the good taste to wear a Marc Bolan T-shirt.\"|The tour promoted the new semi-autobiographical album 'Dandy in the Underworld' which had some good highlights.|1977 - The Singles|Marc released four singles in 1977. The first was a duet with Gloria Jones released on 14th January \"To Know You Is To Love You\", followed on 12th March by 'Soul of My Suit'.|30th May saw the release of 'Dandy in the Underworld' taken from the album of the same name. The song was a song about himself. It spoke of his downfall into the abyss of drugs and destruction and wondered as to when he would return. The word \"cocaine\" was not permitted on UK TV/Radio so Marc changed \"cocaine nights\" with \"T.Rex nights\". Finally on the 5th August 1977 Marc released 'Celebrate Summer' with the line \"Summer is Heaven in Seventy Seven\". Of these four, only 'Soul of My Suit' charted.|1977 - Writing for Record Mirror|During 1977 Marc became a monthly columnist for the music paper 'Record Mirror'.|He wrote of Elvis Presley's death;|\"And so to the saddest news of the month - the death of Elvis Presley. Often badly promoted, badly advised, and obscenely produced in his last years - or so it seemed to me - he was led down the drain by whoever stuck him on the treadmill of these terrible Hollywood musicals and tried to turn him into a sort of Jayne Mansfield. It's sad that he's gone but probably better that he went before he turned into the Bing Crosby of rock'n'roll.\"|1977 - Talk of getting back to his roots with Steve Took and Mickey Finn|In the months before he died Marc was talking of getting back to his roots and performing with his two original partners Mickey Finn and Steve Took. It would have been interested to see where that might have led. Right - Marc Bolan and Steve Took in March 1977 - backstage at one of Marc's gigs on the 'Dandy in the Underworld' Tour.|Read the interview with Marc|recorded on the 9th September 1977 which mentions Mickey Finn and Steve Took.|1977 - Marc Shows|In September 1977 he recorded six programmes for Granada Television 'Marc' to be screened during the Children's Tea-Time slot. Marc looked fit although perhaps a little too thin and mimed through a number of old T.Rex songs with a group of disinterested session musicians as T.Rex. His links were delivered in exquisite Campness and an example was his introduction for the Punk Rock band Generation X where he said the lead singer was supposed to be as \"pretty as me\" (as he finished delivering this line he sniffed a Carnation he had been delicately holding). The last episode in the series (and there was talk of a second) featured Marc dueting with David Bowie. It was recorded on September 13th with a transmission date set for after September 16th. The broadcast went ahead as planned.|1977 - The day a simple tree became Bolan's Rock Shrine|Marc died on September 16th 1977, a fortnight before his 30th birthday. He was a passenger in a Mini driven by Gloria as they headed home from a restaurant.|The car collided with a tree after spinning out of control in Barnes, London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Marc never learned to drive, believing that, like Eddie Cochran, he would die in one.|Eddie Cochran|In Urban legend the story goes: In April 1960 Mark saw his new American hero Eddie Cochran perform at Marc's local 'haunt' the Hackney Empire, where the TV show 'Oh Boy!' was filmed. Apparently after the concert Cochran let the adoring young fan carry his guitar to a waiting limo. Tragically, only days later, on his way to the airport, the star was killed as his taxi slammed into a lamp post. Throughout his life Marc was convinced of the mystical significance of that evening when he was handed Eddie's guitar. \nThe tree now acts as a shrine to his memory, cared for by TAG.|1977 - 20th September - Funeral|At Marc's funeral, attended by many stars, his coffin was covered in a swan-shaped floral tribute, in recognition of his breakthrough hit single. Marc's girlfriend Gloria Jones survived and returned to her native America with their son Rolan Bolan shortly after the crash, just after Rolan had his second birthday.|Posthumously|20th Century Boy introduced a new generation of devotees to Marc's work in 1991 when it was featured on a jeans TV commercial and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. Marc is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence, although he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music; the tunes were never as important as the words.|\"Bolan used to hang around in our office and sit on the floor, strumming his guitar, flirting with our secretary, June, who, of course, he later married. He was a great Syd fan. I was quite fond of him. He was a big pain in the arse, of course, very full of himself. I always liked that thing where he called himself the Bolan child, this magical, mythical name. It was really from his doorbell in Ladbroke Grove. It had his name, and our secretary's surname, Child, so it read Bolan Child and fans used to think, wow, he is the Bolan Child!\"|David Gilmour|Go on to the 2002 Telegraph 'Biography' Article.|Go back to T.Rex - The Golden Years|BACK TO TAG'S MARC BOLAN & T-REX INFORMATION PAGES",
          "|edit|]|Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967, following a handful of failed solo singles and a brief career as lead guitarist in psych-rock band|John's Children|. After a solitary disastrous performance as a four-piece electric rock band on 22 July at the Electric Garden in London's|Covent Garden|alongside drummer Steve Porter plus two older musicians: guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bassist, the group immediately broke up.|[2]|[3]|Subsequently, Bolan retained the band name and the services of Porter, who switched to percussion under the name Steve Peregrin Took, and the two began performing acoustic material as a duo with a repertoire of folk-influenced Bolan-penned songs. Inspired by an influential performance by|Ravi Shankar|whom Bolan had seen while touring West Germany with John's Children, the band adopted a stage manner resembling the performance of traditional Indian music.|[3]|[4]|The combination of Bolan's|acoustic guitar|and distinctive vocal style with Took's|bongos|and assorted percussion\u2014which often included children's instruments such as the|Pixiphone|\u2014earned them a devoted following in the thriving|hippy|underground scene.|BBC Radio One|Disc jockey|John Peel|championed the band early in their recording career.|[5]|Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer|Tony Visconti|, who went on to produce the band's albums well into their second,|glam rock|phase.|[6]|Their debut album|My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair...|remained in the|UK Albums chart|for nine weeks and peaked at number 15.|[7]|Their second album|Prophets, Seers & Sages|was released a few months later.|During 1968\u20131969, Tyrannosaurus Rex had become a modest success on radio and on record. Their third single \"Pewter Suitor\", released in January 1969, failed to chart but their third album|Unicorn|came within striking distance of the|UK Top 10 Albums|.|[7]|While Bolan's early solo material was|rock and roll|-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and|baroque|songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with|Greek|and|Persian mythology|as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.|[8]|Their fourth single \"King of the Rumbling Spires\" issued in July, was a musical departure compared to the previous material: they used a full rock band setup with a drumkit and an entirely electric sound.  However, by mid-1969 there was a rift developing between the two halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Bolan working on his book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|and concentrating on his songs and performance skills. Took, however, had fully embraced the anti-commercial,|drug|-taking ethos of the|UK Underground|scene centred around|Ladbroke Grove|. Took was also attracted to anarchic elements such as|Mick Farren|/|Deviants|and members of the|Pink Fairies|Rock 'n' Roll and Drinking Club.|[9]|Took also began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his bandmate's efforts, rejecting them for the duo's putative fourth album, in production in Spring/Summer 1969. In response to Bolan's rebuff, Took contributed two songs as well as vocals and percussion to|Twink|'s|Think Pink|album.|[10]|Behind the scenes, Bolan's relationship with Took ended after this dispute, although they were contractually obliged to go through with a US tour which was doomed before it began. Poorly promoted and planned, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, Took drew from the|shock rock|style of|Iggy Pop|; Took explained, \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of|Los Angeles|shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"|[11]|Bolan returned to the UK in September and advertised for a replacement for Took. A month later he recruited percussionist|Mickey Finn|.|[6]|and they completed the fourth album, released in early 1970 as|A Beard of Stars|, the final album under the Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. This line up headlined the very first|Glastonbury Festival|in 1970.|[12]|As well as progressively shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums began to show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound.|[13]|Glam rock and commercial success (July 1970 \u2013 December 1972)|[|edit|]|Bolan continued the process of simplification by shortening the band's name to T. Rex.|[14]|The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, \"|Ride a White Swan|\" recorded in July and released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and would soon reach number 2.|[7]|Ticket fees were reduced to 10 shillings/50p to attract a younger audience.|[15]|The eponymous first|T. Rex|album, also recorded that summer, was released in December and continued the move to electric guitars.|[13]|In early 1971,|T. Rex|reached the top 20 of the official|UK Albums Chart|.|[14]|During the February\u2013April 1971 suspension of the official album chart (caused by|a national postal strike|) a chart by|Melody Maker|\u2014which the|Official Chart Company|'s website nowadays recognises as canonical for the gap period\u2014listed the LP as having peaked at number 7.|[16]|[17]|\"Ride a White Swan\" was quickly followed by a second single, \"|Hot Love|\", which reached the top spot on the UK charts, and remained there for six weeks.|[7]|Between these two releases, Bolan first recruited bassist|Steve Currie|, and then drummer|Bill Legend|, to form a full band to record and tour to growing audiences.  After Chelita Secunda added two spots of glitter under Bolan's eyes before an appearance on|Top of the Pops|for which Bolan wore shiny satin trousers and a shiny jacket (from Chelsea boutique Alkasura) in place of his previous hippy clothes, soon followed by another appearance for the show on which he wore a silver velvet/satin sailor suit, the ensuing performances would often be viewed as the birth of glam rock.|After Bolan's displays, glam rock would gain popularity in the UK and Europe during 1971\u20131972. The completion of T. Rex's move to electric guitar rock coincided with Bolan's more overtly sexual lyrical style and image. Having already begun standing up onstage to perform electric songs, Bolan also incorporated more physical showmanship, such as struts, dances and poses, into his stage act.  The group's new image and sound quickly attracted a new audience much to the despair of the band's early fans. Some of the lyrical content of Tyrannosaurus Rex remained, but the poetic, surrealistic lyrics were now interspersed with sensuous grooves, orgiastic moans and innuendo.|In September 1971, T. Rex released|Electric Warrior|, which featured Currie and Legend. Often considered to be their best album, the chart-topping|Electric Warrior|brought much commercial success to the group;|[7]|publicist|BP Fallon|coined the term \"T. Rextasy\" as a parallel to|Beatlemania|to describe the group's popularity.|[18]|The album included T. Rex's best-known song, \"|Get It On|\", which hit number one in the UK. In January 1972 it became a top ten hit in the US, where the song was retitled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\". The album still recalled Bolan's acoustic roots with ballads such as \"Cosmic Dancer\" and the stark \"Girl\". Soon after, Bolan left|Fly Records|; after his contract had lapsed, the label released the album track \"|Jeepster|\" as a single without his permission. Bolan went to|EMI|, where he was given his own record label in the UK\u2014T. Rex Records, the \"T. Rex Wax Co.\"|[3]|The band released the singles \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" respectively in January and in May 1972, and both became number one hits in the UK.|[7]|In May, Bolan's old label Fly released the chart-topping compilation album|Bolan Boogie|, a collection of singles, B-sides and LP tracks, which affected  sales of the band's forthcoming album. When  it was released in July,|The Slider|peaked at number four in the UK,|[7]|and it became their most successful album in the US, entering the top 20 of the|Billboard|200|.|[19]|The band then released two other standalone singles \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\" which both reached number 2 in the UK. In December, Bolan's own rock film|Born to Boogie|was released  to theatres. The film featured two T. Rex shows at the|Empire Pool, Wembley|, which had been shot by|Ringo Starr|and his crew earlier in the year.|Transition, decline and resurgence (January 1973 \u2013 September 1977)|[|edit|]|Bolan performing on ABC's|In Concert|, 1973|Tanx|was a commercial success, reaching number 3 in the German Albums chart,|[20]|number 4 in the UK,|[7]|and number 5 in Norway.|[20]|An eclectic album containing several melancholy ballads and rich production,|Tanx|showcased the T. Rex sound bolstered by extra instrumental embellishments such as|Mellotron|and saxophone. \"The Street and Babe Shadow\" was|funkier|while the last song \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\" was seen by critics as a nod to|gospel|with several female backing singers.|[21]|Released at the same time in March 1973, the heavy rock \"|20th Century Boy|\" was another important success, peaking at number 3 in the UK Singles chart but was not included in the album.|[7]|\"|The Groover|\" marked the end of the golden era in which T. Rex scored 11 singles in a row in the UK top ten.|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|was released in February 1974, and reached number 12 in the UK. Musically, the band ventured into|blue-eyed soul|and blended rock with funk and|R & B|influences.|[22]|Lyrically, the album harkened back to the Tyrannosaurus Rex days with long song titles and lyrical complexity, but was not a critical success. In the US, Warner Brothers dropped the band without releasing the album. Bill Legend stopped working with Bolan at that time. T. Rex had an extended line-up which included second guitarist|Jack Green|and|B. J. Cole|on pedal steel. Soon after the album's release, Bolan split with producer Visconti, then in December 1974, Finn also left the band. A single, \"|Zip Gun Boogie|\", appeared in late 1974 credited as a Marc Bolan solo effort (though still on the T. Rex label). It only reached UK No. 41, and the T. Rex band identity was quickly re-established.|Bolan's Zip Gun|(1975) saw the group further developing the soul and funk of previous records. Most of the material had already been released the previous year in the US as|Light of Love|. It was self-produced by Bolan who, in addition to writing the songs, gave his music a harder, more futuristic sheen. Bolan's own productions were not well received in the music press. However, in the US,|Rolling Stone|magazine gave it a positive review.|[23]|During this time Bolan became increasingly isolated, while high tax rates in the UK drove him into|exile|in Monte Carlo and the US. No longer a vegetarian, Bolan put on weight due to consumption of hamburgers and alcohol, and was ridiculed in the music press.|T. Rex's penultimate album,|Futuristic Dragon|(1976), featured an inconsistent production style that veered from|Wall of Sound|-style songs to|disco|backing, with nostalgic nods to the old T. Rex boogie machine. It only managed to reach number 50, but the album was better received by the critics and featured the singles \"|New York City|\" (number 15 in the UK) and \"|Dreamy Lady|\" (number 30).|[7]|The latter was promoted as T. Rex Disco Party. To promote the album, the band toured the UK, and performed on television shows such as|Top of the Pops|,|Supersonic|and|Get It Together|.|In the summer of 1976, T. Rex released two more singles, \"|I Love to Boogie|\" (which charted at number 13) and \"|Laser Love|\", which made number 42.|[7]|In early 1977|Dandy in the Underworld|was released to critical acclaim. Bolan had slimmed down and regained his elfin looks, and the songs too had a stripped-down, streamlined sound. A spring UK tour with|punk|band|the Damned|on support garnered positive reviews. As Bolan was enjoying a new surge in popularity, he talked about performing again with Finn and Took, as well as reuniting with Visconti.  A six part|TV series|,|Marc|,|presented|by  Bolan and including multiple performances by T.Rex in each episode as well as other artists, was produced in|Manchester|by|Granada Television|for the|ITV|network.|[24]|Bolan's death, disbandment and reformation attempts|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan and his girlfriend|Gloria Jones|spent the evening of 15 September 1977 drinking at the Speakeasy and then dining at Morton's club on|Berkeley Square|, in|Mayfair|, Central London.|[25]|While driving home early in the morning of 16 September, Jones crashed Bolan's purple|Mini 1275 GT|into a tree (now the site of|Bolan's Rock Shrine|), after failing to navigate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, a few miles from his home at 142 Upper Richmond Road West in|East Sheen|.|[26]|While Jones was severely injured, Bolan was killed in the crash, two weeks before his 30th birthday.|[27]|As Bolan had been the only constant member of T. Rex and also the only composer and writer, his management disbanded the remaining group (keyboardist|Dino Dines|and drummer|Tony Newman|- there was a vacancy for bassist) immediately upon his death. Only Legend survives from the band prior to its commercial decline; Took went on to co-found|Pink Fairies|and appear on|Mick Farren|'s solo album|Mona \u2013 The Carnivorous Circus|before spending the 1970s working mostly on his own material, either solo or fronting bands such as|Shagrat|(1970\u20131971) and|Steve Took's Horns|(1977\u20131978).|[28]|He died in 1980 from asphyxiation caused by choking on a|cocktail cherry|.|[29]|The following year Currie, who had played for|Chris Spedding|before moving to Portugal in 1979, died there in a car crash.|[30]|Finn played as a|session musician|for|the Soup Dragons|and|the Blow Monkeys|before his death in 2003 of possible liver and kidney failure.|[31]|Since Bolan's death there have been two known public attempts by former members to reform the band. These have drawn strong criticism from fans and former associates of Bolan who contend that without a living Bolan, no such band can be an authentic lineup.|[32]|[33]|In 1997 Finn, Green and Legend's successor|Paul Fenton|formed a \"T.Rex\" lineup, soon renamed|Mickey Finn's T-Rex|, with former|Smokie|and|Saxon|members. Following Finn's death in 2003 the band continued on as T. Rex (A Celebration of Marc and Mickey) until a petition signed by Legend, Tony Visconti and David Bowie, among others, forced them to revert their name back to Mickey Finn's T-Rex with his family's blessing.|[32]|[34]|[35]|In 2014 Legend put together his own version of the band, Bill Legend's T. Rex, later known as|X-T. Rex|.|[36]|Influence and legacy|[|edit|]|T. Rex vastly influenced several genres over several decades including|glam rock|, the|punk|movement,|post-punk|,|indie pop|,|britpop|and|alternative rock|. They were cited by acts such as|New York Dolls|,|the Ramones|,|Kate Bush|,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|,|Joy Division|,|R.E.M.|,|the Smiths|,|the Pixies|and|Tricky|.|Sylvain Sylvain|of the New York Dolls said that when forming his band with|Billy Murcia|and|Johnny Thunders|: \"[they]'d all sit on the bed with these cheap guitars and do Marc Bolan songs, as well as some blues and instrumentals\".|[37]|Sparks|were inspired at their beginnings by Tyrannosaurus Rex, before T. Rex:|[38]|seeing them live \"was really our education\" stated|Ron Mael|.|[39]|The Stooges|were inspired by T. Rex when composing and recording the songs of|Raw Power|. Guitarist and songwriter|James Williamson|related: \"We were over in England at the time when Marc Bolan was red hot, and we were looking at his stuff and thinking 'hey, we could be like that,' and writing our stuff and just thinking it would take off.\"|[40]|Joey Ramone|of the Ramones said about Bolan: \"I get into people who are unique and innovative and have colour. That's why I love Marc Bolan. There was something so mystical about him, his singing voice, his manner. His songs really move ya, they're so moving and dark.\"|[41]|Siouxsie and the Banshees performed a cover version of \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career, eventually|releasing it as a B-side|in 1979. Joy Division's|Bernard Sumner|was marked by the sound of the guitar of early T. Rex; his musical journey began at a poppy level with \"Ride a White Swan\".|[42]|The Slits|' guitarist|Viv Albertine|was fascinated by Bolan's guitar playing: \"It was [...] the first time I ever listened to a guitar part. Because back then girls didn't really listen to guitar parts, it was a guy's thing. And guitars were really macho things then and I couldn't bear say, Hendrix's guitar playing, it was too in your face and too threateningly sexual, whereas Marc Bolan's guitar playing was kind of cartoony. And I could sing the parts. They weren't virtuoso, they were funny, they were humourous [|sic|] guitar parts.\"|[43]|Smiths' composer and guitarist|Johnny Marr|stated: \"T. Rex was pure pop\".|[44]|\"The influence of T. Rex is very profound on certain songs of the Smiths like \"|Panic|\" and \"|Shoplifters of the World Unite|\". Lead singer|Morrissey|also admired Bolan. While writing \"Panic\" he was inspired by \"Metal Guru\" and wanted to sing in the same style. He didn't stop singing it in an attempt to modify the words of \"Panic\" to fit the exact rhythm of \"Metal Guru\". Marr later stated: \"He also exhorted me to use the same guitar break so that the two songs are the same!\"|[45]|Marr rated Bolan in his ten favourite guitarists.|[46]|Prefab Sprout|'s|Paddy McAloon|cited \"Ride a White Swan\" as \"the song that vindicated my love of pop\".|[47]|R.E.M. covered live \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career in 1984:|[48]|singer|Michael Stipe|said that T. Rex and other groups of the 1970s \"were huge influences on all of us\",|[49]|\"[they] really impacted me\".|[50]|The Pixies's lead guitarist|Joey Santiago|cited|Electric Warrior|in his 13 defining records,|[51]|as did|the Jam|'s|Paul Weller|.|[52]|Santiago said: \"Bolan took the blues and made it a lot more palatable\".|[51]|Kate Bush listened to Bolan during her teenage years and then mentioned his name in the lyrics of the song \"Blow Away (for Bill)\".|[53]|Nick Cave|covered live \"Cosmic Dancer\",|[54]|commenting that|Electric Warrior|contained \"some of the greatest lyrics ever written\",|[55]|further adding, it was \"my favorite record, [...] the songs are so beautiful, it is an extraordinary record\".|[56]|Tricky cited Bolan as \"totally unique and ahead of his time\".|[57]|When talking about his favourite albums,|PJ Harvey|'s collaborator|John Parish|said that T. Rex \"is the place to start\", adding that \"this band and that album [|Electric Warrior|] was what got me into music in the first place\". When he saw T. Rex on Top of the Pops playing \"Jeepster\", he felt: \"that's my kind of music [...] The thing I related to as 12-year-old I still go back to and uses as one of my main touchstones when I'm making records\".|[58]|Parish explained, \"I've been listening to T.Rex pretty consistently since 1971\".|[59]|Oasis|\"borrowed\" the distinct guitar riff from \"Get It On\" on their single \"|Cigarettes & Alcohol|\".|[60]|Oasis's guitarist,|Noel Gallagher|, has cited T. Rex as a strong influence.|[61]|The early acoustic material was influential in helping to bring about|progressive rock|and 21st century|folk music|-influenced singers as|Devendra Banhart|,|[62]|who said: \"I love Tyrannosaurus Rex so much, it's so easy to love, so righteous to love, and so natural to love, I can't imagine anyone not liking it.\"|[63]|T. Rex are referenced in several popular songs, including|David Bowie|'s \"|All the Young Dudes|\" (which he wrote for|Mott the Hoople|in 1972),|[64]|the Ramones' \"|Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?|\",|[65]|Serge Gainsbourg|'s \"Ex-Fan Des Sixties\",|[66]|the Who|'s \"|You Better You Bet|\",|[67]|B A Robertson|'s \"Kool in the Kaftan\",|[68]|R.E.M.'s \"The Wake-Up Bomb\",|[69]|My Chemical Romance|'s \"Vampire Money\",|[70]|and|Panic! at the Disco|'s \"Middle of a Breakup\".|[71]|The music of T. Rex features in the soundtracks of various movies, including|Velvet Goldmine|,|[72]|Death Proof|,|[73]|Billy Elliot|,|[74]|the Bank Job|,|[75]|Dallas Buyers Club|,|[76]|and|Baby Driver|.|[77]|The sleeve of|The Slider|album can be seen in the|Lindsay Anderson|movie|O Lucky Man!|,|[78]|and in|Tim Burton|'s|Dark Shadows|.|[79]|In|Miha Mazzini|'s novel|King of the Rattling Spirits|, the narrator starts remembering his childhood when he sees Tyrannosaurus Rex record \"King of Rumbling Spires\" in the record store and realizes he has mistakenly remembered the title as \"King of the Rattling Spirits\".|[80]|Discography|[|edit|]|Main article:|T.
