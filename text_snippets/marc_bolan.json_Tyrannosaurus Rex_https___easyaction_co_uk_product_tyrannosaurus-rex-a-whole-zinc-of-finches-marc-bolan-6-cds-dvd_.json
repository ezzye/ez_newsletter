Disc 1 in the perfumed Garden with John Peel is very poignant to listen to now and some of the demos on Disc 2 really are amazing. The sound of the live material on disc 3 & 4 isn\u2019t of pristine quality but it\u2019s still wonderful to listen to and nowhere near as bad as some people have remarked in other reviews I\u2019ve seen elsewhere of this item. Disc 5 isn\u2019t up to quality of the first 4 disc but it contains a great interview with a  young and at sometimes nervous Marc lasting over 43 minutes. As always great value from \"Easy Action\" so if your a big Bolan fan what are you waiting for\u2026or better still if you know someone who\u2019s a big fan of Bolan make their Xmas and surprise them with this treasure of a Box Set. This item along with \"The (Incredible) Electric Boogie 71 Box Set\" and the \"Twopenny Prince double CD\" should be in every Bolan fans collection\u2026.it\u2019s Cosmic rock!!
