Rex's Marc Bolan|By|Mark McStea|published|20 July 2021|\u201cMarc is criminally underrated as a guitarist. All rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers love T. Rex, and there\u2019s a little bit of T. Rex in every rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band\u201d|(Image credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)|2021 sees the 50th anniversary of the release of|Electric Warrior|in 1971, for many the ultimate T. Rex album and the perfect encapsulation of Marc Bolan\u2019s genius. Having spent years toiling away on the club and festival circuit with his acoustic duo, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Bolan fully embraced the sound of|electric guitar|and the spirit of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll to score his first hit with|Ride a White Swan|in 1970.|Its massive success turned Bolan into a global superstar, with incredible hit singles appearing every three months for the next three years. Most of the planet was in the grip of T. Rextasy, likened at the time to the fevered devotion of Beatlemania.|While the world was swooning over Bolan\u2019s pin-up looks and killer hooks, the U.S. was strangely resistant, with Bolan\u2019s only notable success being|Bang a Gong|in 1971. Bolan\u2019s run of hits started to dry up in the mid-'70s as the punk era dawned in the U.K., but his influence was immense, to the point that he was one of the few acts that wasn\u2019t subject to the \u201cyear zero\u201d-style condemnation of so much that had preceded punk.",
          "|Electric Warrior|is packed with great moments. The guitar solo on|Mambo Sun|is classic Bolan, perfectly constructed and economical. Did he come prepared or work out his solos in the studio?|\u201cHe did both. Some were made up in the studio, and if you saw him play live, he could really improvise; he had no problem playing a 20-minute solo. [Laughs] He was a smart lad.|Mambo|was worked out at home, including the double-tracked part that was an octave lower.\u201c|Bolan was very hip to the roots of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rockabilly.|Jeepster|owes a huge debt to Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s|You\u2019ll Be Mine|, and|We Love to Boogie|borrows heavily from Webb Pierce\u2019s|Teenage Boogie|, even lifting the solo. Who was influencing him?|\u201cHe was more of a blues guy than me. He listened to the early blues players a lot. We both loved R&B and Little Richard. Little Richard was a huge inspiration to Marc. Marc turned me on to James Burton, those great solos on the Ricky Nelson singles. I\u2019d always loved those records but I\u2019d never known the guitarist\u2019s name. Marc was definitely very knowledgeable.\u201c|For Cosmic Dancer I had about 25 string players. We had the budget because we had the hit|Your string arrangements are an essential component of the T. Rex sound. The strings on|Cosmic Dancer|are a great piece of music in their own right. What was the collaborative process?|\u201cMarc recognized my string writing early in the Tyrannosaurus Rex days and that was my domain exclusively; he wouldn\u2019t question anything or have any suggestions. What he loved was that I would pick up on his riffs and some of his solos and use some of those ideas in the arrangements. For|Cosmic Dancer|I had about 25 string players. We had the budget because we had the hit, of course.|\u201cI was trained classically; I\u2019m a classical guitarist and I studied some writing at school, but I was largely self-taught. I\u2019d have a reel-to-reel and fiddle around with my classical guitar and work the parts out then write them down. It took me ages to write those parts. Now I could do the arrangement for|Cosmic Dancer|in about three hours; at that time it might have taken three days.\u201c|The strings set the T. Rex hits apart from their contemporaries, acts like Slade, Roxy Music and Bowie. They were almost a signature sound for T. Rex.|\u201cWe realized early on that it was a signature sound, as you say.|Bang a Gong|didn\u2019t have a written string part. Marc wanted to go without the strings, but I said that as we\u2019d had a few hits with strings already, maybe we should add some to this one, because, as you say, it was identifiable as his sound.|\u201cThis discussion was taking place while the string players were sitting in their seats. Marc looked slightly terrified at that remark. He said, 'Well, what can we do?' I simply asked the string players to all play the root note of the three chords in the chorus \u2013 G, A and E. It was so simple but it was very effective.\u201c|(Image credit: Michael Putland/Getty Images)|Bolan\u2019s solo on|Lean Woman Blues|is one of his strongest. His vibrato is very distinctive and reminds me of his vocal vibrato. He always seemed very confident in his abilities as a guitarist. Was that a fair assessment or was it bluff?|\u201cHe was unique; he was not bluffing. His technical knowledge guitar-wise was not great at all. He knew a handful of chords, the right ones, of course, for rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. He invented his own technique with that very fast vibrato \u2013 he had very strong hands. I think you\u2019re right in that it probably did go hand-in-hand with his fast vocal vibrato. He did actually woodshed for hours to get that good.|I suspect Hendrix was more aware of what he was doing than Marc was in terms of modality, I think because Hendrix understood jazz|\u201cOne thing that he did that was really weird was that he might be soloing in the key of E, but then he\u2019d slide up three frets and be playing solos out of the G blues box. Some of those notes are modally not the correct notes but he just played with abandon. I think that explains some of his unusual note choices. Sometimes he\u2019d perhaps even slide up another fret from the G position. It gave him almost a Hendrix sensibility; he really loved Hendrix.|\u201cI suspect Hendrix was more aware of what he was doing than Marc was in terms of modality, I think because Hendrix understood jazz. Eric Clapton was another player Marc loved. June [Bolan\u2019s wife] was Eric\u2019s girlfriend before she met Marc. She took him to Clapton\u2019s house for a weekend and Marc told me that he sat on the floor and watched Clapton play for the whole weekend. He said to me, 'I sat at the feet of the master.' He copped a lot of blues techniques from watching Clapton. He was a very quick learner.\u201c|The groove of|Bang a Gong|is irresistible. Something often overlooked on this oft-covered song is the importance of the backing vocals.|\u201cWe all had a go at the backing vocals. Marc had the idea for Flo and Eddie to sing the chorus an octave higher. They cooked up that arrangement between the three of them. They were alumni of Zappa, and I think some of the oohs on the chorus may have come from their time with Frank. Marc and I loved old doo wop, as did Zappa.\u201c|You\u2019ve worked with many great guitarists over the years. How would you rate Marc in comparison?|\u201cThis is where Marc is different from all of the classic rock guitarists. He was cut from a different cloth; he invented himself. He had his own thing. To compare him to Ronson and Fripp and others I\u2019ve worked with is difficult as his recording career was too narrow. Ronson worked with loads of other people so you get an idea of where he stood and how he could adapt his style. We can\u2019t make that comparison for Marc because he never really played with other artists. Marc is criminally underrated as a guitarist. All rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers love T. Rex, and there\u2019s a little bit of T. Rex in every rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band.\u201c|We all knew he could play really fast and accurately and get a great tone out of whatever he played, but what he was doing was exactly the right thing for Ride a White Swan|I would argue that the most important thing for a guitarist to be is \u201ceffective,\u201d to have the ability to deliver exactly what the song requires, regardless of how easy it might be to play. A prime example would be the solo on|Ride a White Swan|, Bolan\u2019s breakthrough hit. He knew when to self-edit, didn\u2019t he?|\u201cYes. We all knew he could play really fast and accurately and get a great tone out of whatever he played, but what he was doing was exactly the right thing for|Swan|. The hooky part was the key to its success and why it broke him through into the major leagues. The riff and solo is almost a Burton/Chet Atkins idea.|Swan|used a capo at the 4th fret so he could play those open string licks. He also played the bass part on my Precision and he again used the capo at the 4th fret as well.|The band members are often overlooked when T. Rex are discussed. Bass player Steve Currie never plays the obvious, predictable lines. His basslines are a key element to the propulsive nature of the rhythm section. Was much time spent working on those ideas in the studio?|\u201cHe was basically left to his own devices. I loved his playing. It was amazing. I can see where his jazz sensibilities came out. Steve would go to places where an average rock player would never venture and often made some simple music sound very complicated. He was one of the secret weapons of the T. Rex sound.\u201c|You\u2019ve produced many iconic albums. Where do you rate|Electric Warrior|?|\u201cI think|Electric Warrior|is my favorite T. Rex album, partly because of the different ways we recorded and how we worked in a lot of studios \u2013 New York, LA and several in London. Marc was on tour so I had to catch him on the road to record. All the strings and mixing were done at Trident Studios in London. It took a lot of work to put the whole album together. I think it was a masterpiece, but I also like the following two albums,|The Slider|and|Tanx|, very much.\u201c|I loved the fact that he dressed to record. He wore his stage gear and his platform shoes. He\u2019d be jumping up and down like he was on stage|Fans will argue that Bolan was undergoing a creative revival at the time of his death. Do you think he could\u2019ve gone on to revitalise himself in terms of creativity and ideas?|\u201cI agree with everyone who says he died too young. In the last couple of years of his life, I think his image was very important to him; he wanted to appeal to the fans that he had who had been teenyboppers, but who were now older. Had he lived I think he would have found someone like myself, or we\u2019d have gotten together again. We did speak to each other after we stopped working together and it was always big hugs and talking about our kids. It was in the cards that we\u2019d do something else.\u201c|What are your fondest memories of working with Marc?|\u201cI loved that the sessions were very live. I also loved the fact that he dressed to record. He wore his stage gear and his platform shoes. He\u2019d be jumping up and down like he was on stage; everything was really great fun. We also invited friends to the sessions, so he liked to see maybe five or six people bouncing about in the control room. He always loved an audience.\u201c|Thank you for reading 5 articles this month*|Join now for unlimited access|US pricing $3.99 per month or $39.00 per year|UK pricing \u00a32.99 per month or \u00a329.00 per year|Europe pricing \u20ac3.49 per month or \u20ac34.00 per year|Join now|Already have an account ?|Sign in here|*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription|Join now for unlimited access|Prices from \u00a32.99/$3.99/\u20ac3.49|Join now|Already have an account ?|Sign in here|Get The Pick Newsletter|All the latest guitar news, interviews, lessons, reviews, deals and more, direct to your inbox!|Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands|Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors|By submitting your information you agree to the|Terms & Conditions|and|Privacy Policy|and are aged 16 or over.|Mark McStea|Social Links Navigation|Mark is a freelance writer with particular expertise in the fields of \u201870s glam, punk, rockabilly and classic \u201850s rock and roll.

Marc was on tour so I had to catch him on the road to record. All the strings and mixing were done at Trident Studios in London. It took a lot of work to put the whole album together. I think it was a masterpiece, but I also like the following two albums,|The Slider|and|Tanx|, very much.\u201c|I loved the fact that he dressed to record. He wore his stage gear and his platform shoes. He\u2019d be jumping up and down like he was on stage|Fans will argue that Bolan was undergoing a creative revival at the time of his death. Do you think he could\u2019ve gone on to revitalise himself in terms of creativity and ideas?|\u201cI agree with everyone who says he died too young. In the last couple of years of his life, I think his image was very important to him; he wanted to appeal to the fans that he had who had been teenyboppers, but who were now older. Had he lived I think he would have found someone like myself, or we\u2019d have gotten together again. We did speak to each other after we stopped working together and it was always big hugs and talking about our kids. It was in the cards that we\u2019d do something else.\u201c|What are your fondest memories of working with Marc?|\u201cI loved that the sessions were very live. I also loved the fact that he dressed to record. He wore his stage gear and his platform shoes. He\u2019d be jumping up and down like he was on stage; everything was really great fun. We also invited friends to the sessions, so he liked to see maybe five or six people bouncing about in the control room. He always loved an audience.\u201c|Thank you for reading 5 articles this month*|Join now for unlimited access|US pricing $3.99 per month or $39.00 per year|UK pricing \u00a32.99 per month or \u00a329.00 per year|Europe pricing \u20ac3.49 per month or \u20ac34.00 per year|Join now|Already have an account ?|Sign in here|*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription|Join now for unlimited access|Prices from \u00a32.99/$3.99/\u20ac3.49|Join now|Already have an account ?|Sign in here|Get The Pick Newsletter|All the latest guitar news, interviews, lessons, reviews, deals and more, direct to your inbox!|Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands|Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors|By submitting your information you agree to the|Terms & Conditions|and|Privacy Policy|and are aged 16 or over.|Mark McStea|Social Links Navigation|Mark is a freelance writer with particular expertise in the fields of \u201870s glam, punk, rockabilly and classic \u201850s rock and roll.
