Rex|/|Marc Bolan|film|Born To Boogie|.\u00a0He spoke at length to journalist and Bolan authority\u00a0Mark Paytress about working with Marc. On the eve of the blu-ray and deluxe reissue of|Born to Boogie|, SDE brings you some highlights from Tony\u2019s conversation with Paytress and some of responses to questions from the audience\u2026|In the beginning\u2026|\u201cT Rex were the first group who rose to the height of The Beatles, in this country [the UK] for sure. I remember I saw Marc, sitting cross-legged with Steve Peregrin Took, at Middle Earth, in Tottenham Court Road \u2013 I knew he was a star and I knew it was going to happen.\u201d|Visconti\u00a0on Marc\u2019s voice|\u201cI looked at this film tonight\u2026 it was almost a Fellini film, that\u2019s what Ringo was after with some of the shots, and Marc was too. When he was in the folk-duo phase, I know he loved the Incredible String Band. But whereas with The Incredible String Band, from Scotland, you could hear every word meticulously pronounced and spoken, Marc was surreal even in his folk period. I thought he was singing in French [laughter], or you know, Croatian or something. So when I approached them the first time, I went to Steve Peregrin Took who definitely spoke English\u2026 I didn\u2019t know where Marc was from, or even if he was from the Earth, he was that surreal. Marc said he was influenced by blues singers from the fifties and playing their records at the wrong speed.",
          "|especially. We didn\u2019t do too much in the studio because we\u2019d record the band live and fresh. Often we\u2019d get to take five, or something like that, and Marc would say \u2018That\u2019s it, we\u2019ve got it\u201d. And [drummer] Bill Legend would say \u201cI\u2019ve only just learnt the song, give us another chance!\u201d but Marc would say \u201cno, that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll throw a few guitars on it and cover up those mistakes\u201d.. or something like that. So we didn\u2019t overwork things or overdo things. When it was finished, it was finished. A lot of the magic took place in the overdub phase, with Marc and his guitar parts. And we\u2019d bring in backing vocals, Flo and Eddie, Lesley Duncan, Vicki Brown\u2026 But it was Marc and myself, doing the high falsettos. Like on|Telegram Sam|, that\u2019s Marc and myself.\u201d|Visconti\u00a0on Marc\u2019s guitar playing|\u201cI saw one [live performance] of|Get It On|in New York City, Fillmore East, where he did that guitar solo for 20 minutes. This [what\u2019s in|Born to Boogie|] is the real abbreviated version! His Hendrix aspirations.. he never quite got there, although I don\u2019t think anyone in the world ever emulated Hendrix. But Marc certainly idolised him.\u201d|Visconti|on Marc\u2019s insecurity|\u201cCertain things he did, I found very strange. At the height of|Hot Love|, we were selling up to 60,000 in one day. Record labels would die if they heard that today. They\u2019d be lucky if they could sell 60,000 in three weeks. I used to ring EMI every day and say \u201cwhat did we do today?\u201d. \u201c60,000\u201d. The phone would ring five minutes later and it would be Marc. \u201cHey, Tone\u2026 we sold 80,000 today\u2026\u201d Why he had to bump it up, I have no idea. But he was insecure. He\u2019d put out so much macho energy. He wasn\u2019t very tall, but sometimes he\u2019d walk towards you and you\u2019d go \u201cwoah\u2026\u201d and step out of the way. Once he did actually kick me in the bollocks [laughter]. He said \u201chey, how\u2019s your Karate coming along?\u201d I said, \u201cfine\u201d, then \u2018boom\u2019. He always had to front up this insecurity, but it was so obvious that he was insecure. But when we had a moment together, when no one else was in the room, he was very loving and gentle.\u201d|Visconti|on Marc\u2019s musical development|\u201c|I think the only mistake made was that, that audience, those girls and the few guys that adored him, grew older. And that\u2019s the way pop works. Just in a few short years, some of them were going over to the Bowie camp and other things and you know, kids do grow up. And it was crystallised in that film, Marc thought that this is the way it\u2019s always going to be. After that we made some fantastic records, I love|The\u00a0Slider|and|Tanx|and all that, but we clearly lost that audience\u2026 it\u2019s ironic now that in later years, a lot of teenage kids look to that music now. But the truth is the core audience [at the time] dwindled and it did make him angry. He couldn\u2019t figure it out and was frustrated.\u201d|Visconti|on personal hygiene|\u201c|Marc and June used to come to my flat to work out arrangements, but also they didn\u2019t have a bathtub, so they\u2019d have their weekly bath at Earl\u2019s Court. Actually it was bi-weekly because they went to Marc\u2019s mum\u2019s too!\u201d|Visconti|on his favourite T Rex music:|\u201cI love|Electric Warrior|,|Slider|and|Tanx|. Like David Bowie has his trilogy, that\u2019s Marc\u2019s.\u201d|Visconti|on parting company with Marc:|\u201c|Zinc Alloy|was supposed to be \u201cone more for the kids\u201d \u2013 it wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t really anything. There\u2019s some great songs on it, but it\u2019s not the best T. Rex album. I don\u2019t like too\u2026 I mean he\u2019s not with us\u2026 but Marc had started drinking heavily \u2013 not that I\u2019m an angel \u2013 but in the studio it was getting ugly and even other members of the band would not be at the sessions. Bill Legend quit at the time. I had one last plea with him, and said why don\u2019t you take some time off\u2026 we had this [unreleased] album,|The Children of Rarn|, on tape somewhere, so I said \u201cwhy don\u2019t you take a year off\u201d. Pete Townshend did it when he wrote Tommy. But no, it was \u201cone more for the kids\u201d which wasn\u2019t helping him with the kids, or anybody, that last album. It\u2019s not the best album. But you know, to take a year off, he looked at me like, \u201care you crazy? I have to make another single\u201d Even the the last single we made together,|Truck On (Tyke)|, didn\u2019t even make the top 30 [Visconti is told that it did \u2013 it actually peaked at number 12] ..well\u2026 it stayed there for a day! It\u2019s sad. He couldn\u2019t accept that. He had to make a better single. But you know, these things have a peak and a trough. Life\u2019s like that. But he couldn\u2019t accept that. So after that, and a couple of other issues I had with him, including payment \u2013 he tried to cut my out of my royalties all of a sudden \u2013 things just soured, it was not the best conditions to work under. One of my best friends was treating me like that, so we called it quits.\u201d|Visconti|on Marc\u2019s legacy:|\u201c|He is one of the all time greats. It\u2019s partly Marc\u2019s fault that he isn\u2019t always recognised as such because he didn\u2019t make it in America. He didn\u2019t do well there for some reason. It overwhelmed him. I saw many of his live performances there and he did not make it with Americans for some reason. The guys with the beards and the flannel shirt were still in power over there, while Glam Rock was a totally British invention. And he was the king of Glam Rock, if you want to pick such a ridiculous title. But Bowie used that platform for a few hours, you know, dyed his hair orange and did some fantastic stuff, but he kept changing and evolving. And he matured. He lived a lot longer than Marc Bolan and had a chance to prove himself time and time again as a person who really recreates himself. Marc was not given that chance. I think if Marc had lived he would have been right up there in that pantheon.\u201d|And in the end\u2026|\u201cWe had a real relationship. We worked nose to nose every day in the studio and I\u2019ll remember him as a dear friend. The last time I saw him? Well, we fell out after|Zinc Alloy|. We didn\u2019t speak to each other for a few years. Then we met backstage at|Top of the Pops|. My ex-wife Mary Hopkin was singing a song in that show and Marc had a song in that show. We met backstage and Marc was with Gloria. We took one look at each other and we had a big hug and a big kiss and \u201clet\u2019s work together again\u201d and all that stuff. Just in the moment, we couldn\u2019t deny it. I could have walked away, Marc could have walked away, but we were attracted to each other like two magnets. And that was the last time I saw him.\u201d|As told to|Mark Paytress|and an invited audience at the BFI in London on 20 May 2016|.

I\u2019ll throw a few guitars on it and cover up those mistakes\u201d.. or something like that. So we didn\u2019t overwork things or overdo things. When it was finished, it was finished. A lot of the magic took place in the overdub phase, with Marc and his guitar parts. And we\u2019d bring in backing vocals, Flo and Eddie, Lesley Duncan, Vicki Brown\u2026 But it was Marc and myself, doing the high falsettos. Like on|Telegram Sam|, that\u2019s Marc and myself.\u201d|Visconti\u00a0on Marc\u2019s guitar playing|\u201cI saw one [live performance] of|Get It On|in New York City, Fillmore East, where he did that guitar solo for 20 minutes. This [what\u2019s in|Born to Boogie|] is the real abbreviated version! His Hendrix aspirations.. he never quite got there, although I don\u2019t think anyone in the world ever emulated Hendrix. But Marc certainly idolised him.\u201d|Visconti|on Marc\u2019s insecurity|\u201cCertain things he did, I found very strange. At the height of|Hot Love|, we were selling up to 60,000 in one day. Record labels would die if they heard that today. They\u2019d be lucky if they could sell 60,000 in three weeks. I used to ring EMI every day and say \u201cwhat did we do today?\u201d. \u201c60,000\u201d. The phone would ring five minutes later and it would be Marc. \u201cHey, Tone\u2026 we sold 80,000 today\u2026\u201d Why he had to bump it up, I have no idea. But he was insecure. He\u2019d put out so much macho energy. He wasn\u2019t very tall, but sometimes he\u2019d walk towards you and you\u2019d go \u201cwoah\u2026\u201d and step out of the way. Once he did actually kick me in the bollocks [laughter]. He said \u201chey, how\u2019s your Karate coming along?\u201d I said, \u201cfine\u201d, then \u2018boom\u2019. He always had to front up this insecurity, but it was so obvious that he was insecure. But when we had a moment together, when no one else was in the room, he was very loving and gentle.\u201d|Visconti|on Marc\u2019s musical development|\u201c|I think the only mistake made was that, that audience, those girls and the few guys that adored him, grew older. And that\u2019s the way pop works. Just in a few short years, some of them were going over to the Bowie camp and other things and you know, kids do grow up. And it was crystallised in that film, Marc thought that this is the way it\u2019s always going to be. After that we made some fantastic records, I love|The\u00a0Slider|and|Tanx|and all that, but we clearly lost that audience\u2026 it\u2019s ironic now that in later years, a lot of teenage kids look to that music now. But the truth is the core audience [at the time] dwindled and it did make him angry. He couldn\u2019t figure it out and was frustrated.\u201d|Visconti|on personal hygiene|\u201c|Marc and June used to come to my flat to work out arrangements, but also they didn\u2019t have a bathtub, so they\u2019d have their weekly bath at Earl\u2019s Court. Actually it was bi-weekly because they went to Marc\u2019s mum\u2019s too!\u201d|Visconti|on his favourite T Rex music:|\u201cI love|Electric Warrior|,|Slider|and|Tanx|. Like David Bowie has his trilogy, that\u2019s Marc\u2019s.\u201d|Visconti|on parting company with Marc:|\u201c|Zinc Alloy|was supposed to be \u201cone more for the kids\u201d \u2013 it wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t really anything. There\u2019s some great songs on it, but it\u2019s not the best T. Rex album. I don\u2019t like too\u2026 I mean he\u2019s not with us\u2026 but Marc had started drinking heavily \u2013 not that I\u2019m an angel \u2013 but in the studio it was getting ugly and even other members of the band would not be at the sessions. Bill Legend quit at the time. I had one last plea with him, and said why don\u2019t you take some time off\u2026 we had this [unreleased] album,|The Children of Rarn|, on tape somewhere, so I said \u201cwhy don\u2019t you take a year off\u201d. Pete Townshend did it when he wrote Tommy. But no, it was \u201cone more for the kids\u201d which wasn\u2019t helping him with the kids, or anybody, that last album. It\u2019s not the best album. But you know, to take a year off, he looked at me like, \u201care you crazy? I have to make another single\u201d Even the the last single we made together,|Truck On (Tyke)|, didn\u2019t even make the top 30 [Visconti is told that it did \u2013 it actually peaked at number 12] ..well\u2026 it stayed there for a day! It\u2019s sad. He couldn\u2019t accept that. He had to make a better single. But you know, these things have a peak and a trough. Life\u2019s like that. But he couldn\u2019t accept that. So after that, and a couple of other issues I had with him, including payment \u2013 he tried to cut my out of my royalties all of a sudden \u2013 things just soured, it was not the best conditions to work under. One of my best friends was treating me like that, so we called it quits.\u201d|Visconti|on Marc\u2019s legacy:|\u201c|He is one of the all time greats. It\u2019s partly Marc\u2019s fault that he isn\u2019t always recognised as such because he didn\u2019t make it in America. He didn\u2019t do well there for some reason. It overwhelmed him. I saw many of his live performances there and he did not make it with Americans for some reason. The guys with the beards and the flannel shirt were still in power over there, while Glam Rock was a totally British invention. And he was the king of Glam Rock, if you want to pick such a ridiculous title. But Bowie used that platform for a few hours, you know, dyed his hair orange and did some fantastic stuff, but he kept changing and evolving. And he matured. He lived a lot longer than Marc Bolan and had a chance to prove himself time and time again as a person who really recreates himself. Marc was not given that chance. I think if Marc had lived he would have been right up there in that pantheon.\u201d|And in the end\u2026|\u201cWe had a real relationship. We worked nose to nose every day in the studio and I\u2019ll remember him as a dear friend. The last time I saw him? Well, we fell out after|Zinc Alloy|. We didn\u2019t speak to each other for a few years. Then we met backstage at|Top of the Pops|. My ex-wife Mary Hopkin was singing a song in that show and Marc had a song in that show. We met backstage and Marc was with Gloria. We took one look at each other and we had a big hug and a big kiss and \u201clet\u2019s work together again\u201d and all that stuff. Just in the moment, we couldn\u2019t deny it. I could have walked away, Marc could have walked away, but we were attracted to each other like two magnets. And that was the last time I saw him.\u201d|As told to|Mark Paytress|and an invited audience at the BFI in London on 20 May 2016|.
