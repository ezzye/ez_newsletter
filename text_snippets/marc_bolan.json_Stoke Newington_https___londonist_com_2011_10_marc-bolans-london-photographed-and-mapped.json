The teenage Mark Feld, to give him his original name, sometimes helped his mother with her job on a stall in Berwick Street Market in Soho. He also worked on the counter at the legendary 2I\u2019s coffee bar at 59 Old Compton Street, which was the spiritual home of British rock n roll. The major home-grown talent \u2013 Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard and Adam Faith - had all played there but the precocious Mark failed to get a gig. Mind you, he was only in his early teens at the time.|He moved with his family to Sun Cottages, Summerstown in Wimbledon and attended Hillcroft School in Beechcroft Road, Tooting (now known as Ernest Bevin College). However, he was much more interested in making a career in music and he became friendly with a teenage star called Allen Warren, who was a presenter on a kids\u2019 TV programme called \u2018Five O\u2019clock Club\u2019. He moved into Allen\u2019s flat at 81 Lexham Gardens in Kensington and soon they had produced a record entitled \u2018You\u2019re No Good\u2019, which rapidly went nowhere."
