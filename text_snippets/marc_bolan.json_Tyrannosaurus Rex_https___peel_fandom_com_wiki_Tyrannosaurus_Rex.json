One memorable moment was when they introduced Take That, who scraped in at 95 with|Back For Good|. They interviewed Jason Orange (I think), who said, \u2018I bet Robbie [Williams] is in there with|Angels|\u2018, and when the interviewer denied this, simply said, \u2018Oh\u2019, with barely disguised satisfaction.|But I digress (considerably). This gave me the idea to include an occasional section of the same ilk, featuring artists whom one would expect for one reason or another to be in the Festive 50 due to their association with John Peel, but who unexpectedly were not.  Marc Bolan\u2019s career was brutally cut short by a car crash in 1977, just as he was welcoming the new breed of punk stars (the Damned supported him on a UK tour). In the 60s, he and Peel were inextricably linked for a while:|Radio 1 DJ John Peel (who\u2019d narrated a poem on the album [|My People Were Fair And Had Sky In Their Hair But Now They\u2019re Content To Wear Stars On Their Brows|]) virtually made it his mission in life to bring the work of Marc Bolan to the public\u2019s attention, and as a consequence of his patronage, the duo\u2019s debut album-and|Debora,|the single that preceded it-charted. Throughout 1968, the DJ\u2019s \u2018Peelmobile\u2019 made regular trips up and down the nation\u2019s motorways, spreading peace and loveliness across the land at countless group-plus-DJ hippie happenings.  Peel and Bolan hung out at gigs, visited ancient sites such as Stonehenge and Glastonbury Tor, and sought out old rock\u2019n\u2019roll 45s in obscure secondhand emporiums.|[Sleeve notes to Tyrannosaurus Rex,|Prophets, Seers And Sages The Angels Of The Ages,|expanded edition, by Mark Paytress]",
          "|There is a hint here as to the rift between the two that resulted in Bolan claiming that John was just looking for a band to exploit. Whatever the reason, on that radio programme, John chose the first of the two tracks below as his and Sheila\u2019s favourite from Marc\u2019s early recordings, before the glam rock era (\u2018Marc, certainly in those early days, had a very extreme voice\u2019): but I chose the second because the energy predated punk in the minor key and explosive guitar riff that opens the song (which was, after all, covered by no less a group than Siouxsie and The Banshees). But neither Marc nor his band appeared in the Festive 50 in any shape or form.
