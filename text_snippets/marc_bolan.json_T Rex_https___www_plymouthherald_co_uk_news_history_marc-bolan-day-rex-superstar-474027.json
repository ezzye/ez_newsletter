          "|Protestors will march across the Tamar Bridge to make a stand against the controversial toll payments. A growing number of people who live in south east Cornwall are fed up with paying what for many is hundreds of pounds a year to cross.",
          "|The Tamar Toll Action Group, alongside Cornish campaigning group All Under One Banner (AUOB) Kernow, has organised a \"call to action\" peaceful protest march across the bridge on Saturday, July 27, which also happens to be the same day as the busy",
          "|He said: \u201cSince the bridge was built, we have been paying tolls which were originally to be used to fund the original building of the structure. In the 1970s the UK government moved the A38 from the Torpoint ferry crossing to the Tamar Bridge but have never paid a penny for the crossing of the bridge, despite the fact that it is owned by Cornwall and Plymouth and not Westminster. This cannot be allowed to continue.|\u201cWhen the two councils voted to increase charges, a number of us opposed this and one of the reasons was that National Highways, which is run by the government, had not been charged for using our facilities. All local people are charged, why not them?\"|Cllr Long added: \"It is grossly offensive to suggest we have to \u2018provide a fully costed business plan\u2019 to plead for funding to them. That is not just. It\u2019s our bridge, we run it with Plymouth along with the ferry, and the UK government just need to pay their fair toll for using this so its about time we cut to the chase and billed them for the use.\"|For years both councils have been writing to ministers asking for some assistance but until now it\u2019s been rebuffed saying they need to provide a business plan. In this new move, Cllr Long says that the government should pay for using the crossing. He has written to Cornwall Council's portfolio holder for transport Connor Donnithorne requesting that the matter be pursued.|The toll action group recently discovered that small print in a government act demonstrated that if both Cornwall and Plymouth councils dropped the tolls, Highways England would have to pick up the tab for the upkeep of the bridge.|The original Tamar Bridge Act of 1957 states that if tolls are stopped, the local councils would still be responsible for maintaining the bridge. However, the group says an updated 1979 Act contradicts that.|The group's vice-chairman Scott Slavin said: \"The 1979 Act replaces it with the requirement that if tolls are discontinued the bridge shall become a highway maintainable at public expense. Providing Plymouth City and Cornwall Council are in agreement they can drop the tolls on the bridge at any time and Highways England would have to assume responsibility for its maintenance.\"|Follow|PlymouthLive|Facebook|Twitter|Comment|More On|Tamar Bridge|Traffic and Travel|News|all|Most Read|Most Recent|Plymouth Hoe|Urgent appeal to find missing girl last seen on Plymouth Hoe|The 15-year old was last seen on Plymouth Hoe|Understated part of Plymouth where super cool businesses are thriving|Stonehouse|Well known for its nightclubs old and new, this Plymouth area has something to offer all communities in the city|Two men charged with Stoke Village murder after man dies in hospital|Courts|Cowin Fuoco-Fisher and James Caswell were initially charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent have been returned to court to face a joint charge of murder|Quirky Plymouth bungalow has a super cool games room and bar in the garden|property news|The Plymstock home has four bedrooms and an integral garage|Long delays on Tamar Bridge A38 heading into Cornwall|A38|There is a large amount of congestion being reported on the A38|Plymouth Hoe|Urgent appeal to find missing girl last seen on Plymouth Hoe|The 15-year old was last seen on Plymouth Hoe|Devon waterpark with 65ft near-vertical drop is one of the UK's best|Things to do Plymouth|Quaywest opened a brand new slide this year, named 3-Fall.
