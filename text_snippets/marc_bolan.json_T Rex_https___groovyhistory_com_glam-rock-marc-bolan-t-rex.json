Long-time producer|Tony Visconti|, friends and former associates relate for|John Robinson|the triumph of one of music\u2019s most complex characters as he ushered in the glam rock era. Here\u2019s an extract:|The broadcaster|Bob Harris|saw|Marc Bolan|become the king of glam rock from the back of a car in Glasgow, in the spring of 1971. After the No 1 success of \u201cHot Love\u201d, this was a tour on which he witnessed scenes otherwise familiar only from footage of Beatlemania: police escorts, crushed cars, stampeding fans.|\u201cThe first gig was Portsmouth Guildhall,\u201d remembers|Harris|, then acting as|T.Rex\u2019s|tour support and MC. \u201cThe band finished their set, and we were hanging out. We realised there was a lot of noise in the street \u2013 the whole crowd was round the backstage door. Local police had arrived. The whole place was surrounded by girls with scissors trying to get locks of Marc\u2019s hair. What I remember is a lot of stainless steel flashing around at eye level. It was madness!\u201d"
