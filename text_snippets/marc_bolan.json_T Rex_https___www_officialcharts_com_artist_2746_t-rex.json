Rex were an English rock band, formed in 1967 by singer, songwriter, poet and guitarist Marc Bolan (born Mark Feld in Hackney, London on September 30, 1947). They were initially called Tyrannosaurus Rex, releasing four psychedelic folk albums under this name. T. Rex became one of the first post-Beatles acts to enjoy that level of success, with four UK Official Singles Chart Number 1s including Hot Love and Get It On in the very early 1970s. Marc Bolan spearheaded a whole movement of glam rock turns that would soon flood the pop chart. T. Rex had three UK Official Album Chart Number 1s with Electric Warrior and Bolan Boogie, as well as the reissue of earlier Tyrannosaurus Rex long players Prophets, Seers & Sages: The Angels of the Ages /My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows as a double pack (and also possibly in a bid to have the longest album title ever). Marc Bolan had his own TV show, which featured stars such as David Bowie and Cilla Black, as well as showcasing new bands such as The Damned. Marc Bolan sadly died a fortnight shy of his 30th birthday in on September 16, 1977.|TYRANNOSAURUS REX|Songs|stats|UK No. 1s|4|UK Top 10s|11|UK Top 40s|21|UK Top 75s|28|Weeks in the Top 1|16|Weeks in the Top 10|70|Weeks in the Top 40|179|Weeks in the Top 75|229|TYRANNOSAURUS REX|Albums|stats|UK No. 1s|3|UK Top 10s|9|UK Top 40s|18|UK Top 75s|22|Weeks in the Top 1|12|Weeks in the Top 10|67|Weeks in the Top 40",
