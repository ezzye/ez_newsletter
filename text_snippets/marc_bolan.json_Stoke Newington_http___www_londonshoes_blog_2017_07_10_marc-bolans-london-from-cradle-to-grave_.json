Marc Bolan (real name \u2013 Marc Feld) was born on 30th September 1947 in Stoke Newington-N16, north east London, and lived with his parents and his older brother, in a ground floor flat at 25 Stoke Newington Common.|As a youngster he was obsessed with popular music and the stardom that went with it, and spent a lot of his early teen years at the famous 2I\u2019s Coffee Bar in Old Compton Street-W1 \u2013 where he would watch performances of all the young \u2018Elvis\u2019 wannabe\u2019s of that time such as Cliff Richard, Tommy Steele and Adam Faith.|After a couple of disastrous attempts at starting his own \u2018band\u2019, but still with a burning desire to \u2018make it\u2019 in the music business \u2013 Bolan decided to adopt a minimalistic approach and formed a duo with a guy called Steve Peregrine Took, with just Bolan on acoustic guitar and Took on bongo\u2019s and other assorted minimal percussion \u2013 and the duo performed under the name \u201cTyrannosaurus Rex\u2019|Bolan always believed himself to be a \u2018poet\u2019, and drew his inspiration from Tolkien fantasies such as The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings \u2013 which led to him writing whimsical \u2018folk\u2019 type songs with lyrics about mystical characters and fantasies. His \u2018way-out\u2019 unique melodies and lyrics were ideal fodder for the \u2018hippy\u2019 ethos of the late 60\u2019s \u2013 and very soon Tyrannosaurus Rex were one of the \u2018in\u2019 acts within the hippy underworld culture of that time. The duo were soon performing regularly at university venues up and down the country, and became regular favourites at the \u2018Middle Earth\u2019 club in King Street Covent Garden-W1, that was run by the late \u2018underground\u2019 DJ John Peel.",

Sadly, Bolan did not move with the ever changing times, in terms of his song writing \u2013 and after a couple of years of unprecedented success his popularity started to fade. With the advent of \u2018Punk\u2019 rock, he did experience a slight resurgence in interest, when he was referenced by many of the major punk bands as the \u2018Godfather of Punk\u2019 \u2013 but he, nor T.Rex could ever regain the heights of success achieved in the very early 1970\u2019s.|Marc Bolan lived life in the fast lane and always said that he would never make the age of 30 \u2013 and sadly on the 16th September 1977, whilst being driven home by his then girlfriend (singer Gloria Jones) from a night out at a west-end restaurant \u2013 the car hit a tree on the Queens Ride stretch of road in Barnes-SW13.

Marc Bolan (real name \u2013 Marc Feld) was born on 30th September 1947 in Stoke Newington-N16, north east London, and lived with his parents and his older brother, in a ground floor flat at 25 Stoke Newington Common.|As a youngster he was obsessed with popular music and the stardom that went with it, and spent a lot of his early teen years at the famous 2I\u2019s Coffee Bar in Old Compton Street-W1 \u2013 where he would watch performances of all the young \u2018Elvis\u2019 wannabe\u2019s of that time such as Cliff Richard, Tommy Steele and Adam Faith.|After a couple of disastrous attempts at starting his own \u2018band\u2019, but still with a burning desire to \u2018make it\u2019 in the music business \u2013 Bolan decided to adopt a minimalistic approach and formed a duo with a guy called Steve Peregrine Took, with just Bolan on acoustic guitar and Took on bongo\u2019s and other assorted minimal percussion \u2013 and the duo performed under the name \u201cTyrannosaurus Rex\u2019|Bolan always believed himself to be a \u2018poet\u2019, and drew his inspiration from Tolkien fantasies such as The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings \u2013 which led to him writing whimsical \u2018folk\u2019 type songs with lyrics about mystical characters and fantasies. His \u2018way-out\u2019 unique melodies and lyrics were ideal fodder for the \u2018hippy\u2019 ethos of the late 60\u2019s \u2013 and very soon Tyrannosaurus Rex were one of the \u2018in\u2019 acts within the hippy underworld culture of that time. The duo were soon performing regularly at university venues up and down the country, and became regular favourites at the \u2018Middle Earth\u2019 club in King Street Covent Garden-W1, that was run by the late \u2018underground\u2019 DJ John Peel.",
          "|The rest, as they say \u2013 is history\u2026..because by simply applying a little bit of \u2018glitter\u2019 to his cheeks and wearing flamboyant colourful clothes \u2013 and latching on to a song writing formula that produced \u2018number 1\u2019 chart hits such as:- Hot Love / Get It On / Metal Guru / Telegram Sam / Jeepster / Children of the Revolution / 20th Century Boy \u2013 plus 2 massive selling albums:- Electric Warrior / The Slider\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026a \u2018Star\u2019 a \u2018Teen Idol\u2019 and in particular, \u2018Glam Rock\u2019 was born.|With \u2018Bolan-mania\u2019 in full force, and his privacy threatened, Marc moved out of his Blenheim Crescent flat in Ladbroke Grove and relocated to a more secure and secluded apartment at Bilston Towers in Great Marlborough Street-W1. With massive record sales, and sell out concerts all over the country, the culmination of the success of T.Rex was a sell-out concert at the then Empire Pool \u2013 Wembley in 1972 (I was there by the way), which was filmed by the Beatle Ringo Starr, and released as the movie \u2018Born to Boogie\u2019. Sadly, Bolan did not move with the ever changing times, in terms of his song writing \u2013 and after a couple of years of unprecedented success his popularity started to fade. With the advent of \u2018Punk\u2019 rock, he did experience a slight resurgence in interest, when he was referenced by many of the major punk bands as the \u2018Godfather of Punk\u2019 \u2013 but he, nor T.Rex could ever regain the heights of success achieved in the very early 1970\u2019s.|Marc Bolan lived life in the fast lane and always said that he would never make the age of 30 \u2013 and sadly on the 16th September 1977, whilst being driven home by his then girlfriend (singer Gloria Jones) from a night out at a west-end restaurant \u2013 the car hit a tree on the Queens Ride stretch of road in Barnes-SW13. Gloria Jones was badly injured, but Bolan died instantly.|Plaques commemorating his life are on display at the Golders Green Crematorium and his childhood home at 25 Stoke Newington Common \u2013 and, at the exact site of the car crash that ended his life, 2 memorial \u2018shrines\u2019 exist, one put there by \u2018the fans\u2019 and the other by the \u2018Performing Rights Society\u2019 \u2013 These have been and will no doubt continue to be, visited by hundreds of fans from all over the globe.|Marc Bolan \u2013 a London boy from the \u2018Cradle to the Grave\u2019|25 Stoke Newington Common, London N16 \u2013 The childhood home of Marc Feld (Bolan) \u2013 at the time of his birth on 30th Sept 1947|Me, outside Marc\u2019s childhood home at 25 Stoke Newington Common, London N16|The commemorative plaque on display at Marc\u2019s childhood home at 25 Stoke Newington Common, London N16|Entrance to what was the 2I\u2019s Coffee Bar in Old Compton Street, London W1|Me \u2013 outside the old 2I\u2019s Coffee Bar \u2013 Old Compton Street, London W1|The site of what was the Middle Earth club, in King St, Covent Garden \u2013 where Tyrannosaurus Rex were regularly on the bill|An old advertising poster/flyer for the Middle Earth Club, Covent Garden \u2013 showing Tyrannosaurus Rex on the bill|Another flyer of the time \u2013 advertising Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s appearance on the bill of the Middle Earth Club, Covent Garden|57 Blenheim Crescent, Ladbroke Grove, London W11 \u2013 where Marc Bolan and June Child occupied the top-floor flat during the late 60\u2019s early 70\u2019s|Bilston Towers, Great Marlborough Street, London W1 \u2013 where Marc Bolan moved into a flat, to get some peace & quiet following his success at the peak of T.Rexstacy|Me \u2013 with Bilston Towers in the background|Poster for the historic gig by Bolan and T.Rex at the very top of their game \u2013 held at what was the Empire Pool, Wembley in 1972.
