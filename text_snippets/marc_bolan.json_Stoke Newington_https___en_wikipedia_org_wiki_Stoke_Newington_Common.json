On 8 May 2004 a food market was launched on Saturdays which has since become firmly established.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://broadwaymarket.co.uk/history_part2/\n |title=History\u2014The Twentieth Century\n |website=Broadway Market\n |access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref> Broadway Market is closed to traffic when the market is being held (9am\u20135pm). Thanks largely to the market a number of new restaurants and boutiques have opened in the area.\n\nThe ongoing development of Broadway Market has sparked a local debate about the perceived [[gentrification]] of Hackney and the way Hackney council disposed of some of their commercial property portfolio.  In late 2005, a group of local protestors occupied 34 Broadway Market (Francesca's caf\u00e9) to bring attention to the issue.  Despite being evicted on 21 December 2005 the building was successfully reoccupied on 27 December (replacing the demolished roof in the process) before the protestors were again evicted on 23 February 2006.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081018205210/http://www.emily-james.com/Site/THE_BATTLE_FOR_BROADWAY_MARKET.html The Battle for Broadway Market] (documentary) Emily James, 2006</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Image:BdwyMktFreshProduce.jpg|thumb|A fruit stall in the street's market]]\nThe market was the location of filming for some scenes in the 1947 film ''[[Odd Man Out]]'', and the opening scenes of the 1988 movie ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' were shot at the [[Regent's Canal]] end of the street. The market, and specifically the barber shop, was the location for David Cronenberg's 2007 film, ''[[Eastern Promises]]'', and the market and surrounding area appeared in the [[Netflix]] drama series ''[[Top Boy]]''.\n\nAlong with many squares and streets in the East End of London, it is rumoured that the old Broadway Market partly inspired the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Broadway market occupation 1.jpg|Francesca's caf\u00e9 re-occupied after some demolition.

          "|'s Public Control Committee states that the Market had existed since 1883 on the southern end of the Street between Andrew Street and Duncan Road and consisted of 35 stalls selling: vegetables and fruit, flowers, eggs, meat, fish, bacon, earthenware, drapery, iron and tinware, mats and pails, and caps and belts. The report describes a growing market serving a local, over-crowded, working-class community.",
          "|Of the 35 stalls 10 are recorded as being run by Broadway Market shopkeepers with the remainder being independent street traders.",
          "|Broadway Market is closed to traffic when the market is being held (9am\u20135pm). Thanks largely to the market a number of new restaurants and boutiques have opened in the area.",
          "|The ongoing development of Broadway Market has sparked a local debate about the perceived|gentrification|of Hackney and the way Hackney council disposed of some of their commercial property portfolio.  In late 2005, a group of local protestors occupied 34 Broadway Market (Francesca's caf\u00e9) to bring attention to the issue.  Despite being evicted on 21 December 2005 the building was successfully reoccupied on 27 December (replacing the demolished roof in the process) before the protestors were again evicted on 23 February 2006.|[4]|In popular culture|[|edit|]|A fruit stall in the street's market|The market was the location of filming for some scenes in the 1947 film|Odd Man Out|, and the opening scenes of the 1988 movie|Buster|were shot at the|Regent's Canal|end of the street. The market, and specifically the barber shop, was the location for David Cronenberg's 2007 film,|Eastern Promises|, and the market and surrounding area appeared in the|Netflix|drama series|Top Boy|.|Along with many squares and streets in the East End of London, it is rumoured that the old Broadway Market partly inspired the|BBC|soap opera|EastEnders|.|Gallery|[|edit|]|Francesca's caf\u00e9 re-occupied after some demolition.

The market, and specifically the barber shop, was the location for David Cronenberg's 2007 film, ''[[Eastern Promises]]'', and the market and surrounding area appeared in the [[Netflix]] drama series ''[[Top Boy]]''.\n\nAlong with many squares and streets in the East End of London, it is rumoured that the old Broadway Market partly inspired the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''.|Edit summary|(Briefly describe your changes)|By publishing changes, you agree to the|Terms of Use|, and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the|CC BY-SA 4.0 License",

It was built in the early 19th century and was London's|hay|and|straw|market for a hundred years until the late 1920s.  An arm of the|Regent's Canal|was built to the market.  The market was surrounded by modest housing, and in the early 20th century became an artistic community.  The original houses were demolished during and after the|Second World War|and it is now a housing estate, known as|Regent's Park Estate|.|Origins|[|edit|]|The land to the east of|John Nash|'s|Regent's Park|development had originally been laid out as a service district with small houses for tradesmen and three large squares intended for the marketing of|hay|, vegetables and meat.,|[1]|[2]|Only Cumberland Market, the northernmost square survived as a commercial area.  London's hay market relocated here from the",
          "|were brought in for sale at the Market and for the nearby",
          "|that was eighty-two feet deep and with a capacity of 1,500 tons under the Market.",
          "|Clarence Market, the next square to the south, was intended to be a centre for the distribution of fresh vegetables brought in from the",
          "|The houses in Clarence and Cumberland Markets were modest and the work of speculative builders who put up \"run-of-the-mill products without the slightest obligation to make architecture.\"",
          "|The southernmost square began as York Market but it never found use as a trading place and the name was later changed to Munster Square.  Although its houses were tiny, with a single window on each of their three storeys, they were well-designed and perfectly proportioned.",
          "|In the NW corner of Cumberland Market, in",
          "|Ophthalmic|Hospital for Sir|William Adams|,|George IV|'s|oculist|.  For several years Adams gave his services free to soldiers whose eyesight had been affected in the military campaigns in|Egypt|.  The hospital was closed in 1822 and for a time it was used as a factory for manufacturing Bacon's and Perkin's 'steam guns'.  In 1826 it was purchased by Sir|Goldsworthy Gurney|for the construction of his famed 'steam carriages', one of which made the journey from|London|to|Bath|and back, in July 1829.  However, unable to market these vehicles Gurney was forced to sell the premises in 1832.  Bought by Sir|Felix Booth|, the|gin|distiller|the building survived as a landmark, although badly bombed, until demolition in 1968.|Park Village East from the Cumberland Arm. From an original study by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd (1793\u20131864), pub 1831. Produced from Shepherd's series \"Metropolitan Improvements; or London in the Nineteenth Century\".|Beside the|Ophthalmic|Hospital was Christ Church (now St. George's Cathedral), built by Nash's assistant, Sir|James Pennethorne|in 1837 to serve the largely working class district.|[10]|However, a series of later alterations gradually made the church more appropriate for high-church worship, and in time the windows were filled with stained glass, including a panel by|Dante Gabriel Rossetti|, whose family worshipped there.|[11]|The steeple of Christ Church, dominated Cumberland Market as did the nearby chimney of William Grimble's gin distillery, also in|Albany Street|.  In 1840 Grimble decided to embark on producing|vinegar|from spirit left over from the distilling process.  He went into partnership with Sir|Felix Booth|, and they set up premises in the North East corner of the Market.  The venture was unsuccessful so they turned to the more conventional method of vinegar brewing.  The brewery burnt down in 1864 and was rebuilt and extended soon after.|[12]|Growth of Railways|[|edit|]|The growth of the railway network and the opening of|Euston Station|in 1837 caused enormous upheaval and was one of the factors that led to the rapid decline of the area.  Bringing in \"noise, dirt,|Irish|navvies|, and semi-itinerant railway workers\"|[13]|Charles Dickens|likened the railway works cutting their way through|Camden Town|to a \"great earthquake\".|[14]|More industry developed in the area than was originally planned as factories began to spring up near the canal and railway and this put even more pressure on land for housing.  Houses that were originally built for middle-class families were taken over by incomers.  The terraces of|Mornington Crescent|and|Arlington Road|, for example, were ideal for multi occupation for as many as nine or ten people could be accommodated in each.|[15]|By 1852 the|Midland Railway|was transporting around a fifth of the total|coal|to|London|through both|Euston|and King's Cross.|[|citation needed|]|Ironically the canal proved useful in the construction of both King's Cross and|St Pancras|in terms of getting the building materials to the site.|[|citation needed|]|Although still in use the Regent's Canal carried less and less until by the 1850s the Cumberland Basin was described as \"no better than a stagnant putrid ditch\".|[16]|Cholera|spread through the families of men who were employed on the barges and in the wharves around it and took hold in the overcrowded neighbourhood.|The housing situation was to become worse in the following decade.  Some 4,000 houses were demolished in the area to the east of Cumberland Market to make way for the new|St Pancras Station|in 1868.  As many as 32,000 people were displaced, most with no form of compensation.|[17]|By the late nineteenth century a dramatic social divide had developed in this part of London with Cumberland Market in the middle.  Just over one hundred metres to the west were the wealthy occupants of|Nash|'s|Chester Terrace|while a short distance to the east were areas characterised by|Charles Booth|, the social commentator, as being occupied by the very poor, of those in \"chronic want\".|Throughout its existence the hay market operated for three days a week alongside a general produce market.  The central cobbled market place, enclosed by|cast-iron|posts linked with chains, was surrounded by modest houses of varying styles.  Most of the houses were of three storeys, some with a basement.  Although originally they do not appear to have had shops the lower floors of many were subsequently converted to business.|[18]|Twenty-one separate businesses are recorded in Cumberland Market at the beginning of the twentieth century together with four|pubs|.|The canal had proved to be a very efficient means of bringing in stone to the Cumberland Basin and a number of monumental|masonry|and|statuary|businesses had sprung up in the|Euston Road|to take advantage of this.|Artistic community|[|edit|]|As well as monumental|statuary|the availability of|stone|, combined with cheap rents and its proximity to the centre of town had attracted a number of|sculptors|and|artists|to set up|studios|in the Cumberland Market area. Amongst the former were|Mario Raggi|;|John Henry Foley|and Sir|Thomas Brock|.|[19]|Sir Frederic (later Lord)|Leighton|also had his sculptor's studio in Osnaburgh Street.|Walter Sickert|in 1884.|Fred Winter, the treasurer of the|New English Art Club|, sculpted at No.13 Robert Street and|Walter Sickert|painted in the next door studio in 1894 sharing it for a while with his former master|Whistler|. Some years later|C.R.W. Nevinson|rented the same studio and it was there that he painted his works for his second exhibition of War Paintings at the|Leicester Galleries|of 1918.|[20]|In 1909-10 Sickert had taken a studio at No. 21 Augustus Street, which he called the \"Vinegar Factory\" as it had been part of Grimble's Factory.|[21]|Here he taught|etching|. His|Cumberland Market|painting of ca. 1910 which was made at the south end of Augustus Street shows the side window of Charles Chase's bakers shop at No. 24 Cumberland Market.|[22]|Today Cumberland Market is best remembered as the home of|Robert Bevan|'s|Cumberland Market Group|for it was in his first floor studio of No. 49 that he and his colleagues held their Saturday afternoon \"At Homes\" in the early days of the|First World War|.|The artist|William Roberts|also worked in the Market at this time and mentioned other neighbours as having been|Bernard Meninsky|, John Flanagan,|Colin Gill|, and Geoffrey Nelson.|[23]|In her \"The Hay-Market\" of 1914|Charlotte Mew|, the poet, gave a vivid picture of Cumberland Market and its residents. Her account of a woman walking across it with her young daughter might almost have been a description of one of Bevan's better-known paintings of this period.|[24]|Another writer attracted to the area was the American \"Tramp Poet\" Harry Kemp, who rented two rooms in the Market in late 1913.|[25]|It was there one morning, woken from an|absinthe|-induced|hangover|, by the tap-tapping of a blind man in the Market below that he wrote \"Blind\".|Social Conditions|[|edit|]|A few years beforehand, concerned by the poor conditions in which many were living|Mary Neal|, a|philanthropist|, set out to help girls working in the|dressmaking|trade.  With|Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence|she established the|Esp\u00e9rance Girls' Club|at No. 50 Cumberland Market.  This was open nearly every night of the week from 8 to 10 o'clock. One evening every week was set apart for a singing class, another for musical drill, another for games, or sewing or cooking.|[26]|Having heard of|Cecil Sharp|'s collection of folk songs in 1905 she asked him for suitable ones that might be taught to the girls.  This proved to be such a success that he was asked to recommend dances to go with the songs.  Within a short time the Esp\u00e9rance girls were putting on demonstrations around the country.|[27]|Sharp collaborated with Herbert MacIlwaine, the musical director of the club, to produce the first of the Morris books.|Mary Neal|had been an early supporter of the|Women's Social and Political Union|and the|Esp\u00e9rance Club|danced at many of their events.  This proved to be one of the reasons for Sharp and Neal to fall out and although she went on to publish two Esp\u00e9rance Morris books, the Club closed during the|First World War|.|The theme of social change remained strong in Cumberland Market, for in 1916 Miss M.M. Jeffery, who had been the reformer|Octavia Hill|'s secretary, took over three rooms at No. 42.  She had been appointed to manage the Cumberland Market (London) Estate of the Commissioners of Crown Lands (later the|Crown Estate|Commissioners).  This was an estate 'of about 850 houses divided into about 2,000 tenancies, occupied by a population of about 7,000'.|[28]|Decline|[|edit|]|A market continued on the site right up until the late 1920s, and the last trading|barges|ceased sometime in 1930.  Local businesses were in terminal decline and by 1931 only five remained and the King's Head was the sole surviving pub.  In the same year the buildings on the north side of the Market were demolished, including Grimble's Vinegar Factory, and replaced by|council housing|.|In August 1938 the Cumberland Basin was dammed off and drained and in the next two years it was formally abandoned.  By 15 January 1941 the Basin had been filled in with rubble from London's bombing and in the years following the|Second World War|the site was covered with|topsoil|and turned into|allotments|.|[29]|Being so close to both|Euston|and King's Cross stations it was inevitable that the area would have been so heavily bombed during the|Second World War|.  A|V1 rocket|landed on the NE corner in 1944 and the buildings on the SE corner were damaged beyond repair.  General blast damage was also sustained in the SW corner.|[30]|The remaining buildings were demolished in 1950 and in 1951 the Crown Estate Commissioners sold the 32 acres (130,000\u00a0m|2|) on which Munster Square, Clarence Gardens and Cumberland Market stood to|St Pancras Borough Council|for the building of a housing estate, known as Regent's Park Estate.|Notes and references|[|edit|]|^|Much of this has been taken from \"Straws from Cumberland Market\" by|Patrick Baty|in the catalogue for \"A Countryman in Town: Robert Bevan and the Cumberland Market Group\" at Southampton City Art Gallery.

The market was between Farringdon Street east and Shoe Lane west, north of Stonecutter Street, in the|City of London|ward of|Farringdon Without|.|[1]|The market covered 1.5 acres (0.01\u00a0km|2|) and cost about \u00a3250,000. On 20 November 1829, the market opened and was described in a contemporary account: \"It forms a handsome and elevated quadrangle, of 232 feet by 150 feet. The purchase of the ground, and the buildings which stood thereon, is estimated in round numbers at \u00a3200,000; the building of the market, including paviours' accounts, &c., is stated at \u00a380,000. The avenue under which are the shops of the dealers, and which extends round three sides of the building, is 25 feet high, to what are technically termed the tie-beams, with ventilators ranged at equal distances. \u2026 In the centre of the roof of the principal avenue a turret and clock have been placed. \u2026 The chief entrance to the market is by two gates, for wagons, &c., in Stonecutter Street, which has been made double its former width, and two smaller ones for footpassengers; besides these, on each side of the quadrangle, massive oak doors are to be thrown open, from morning till the close of public business.\"",

          "|visited the market one November morning. The poor, he says, were there, in every style of rags, laying in the necessary stock for their trade [of selling watercress in the streets]. \"As the morning twilight drew on, the paved court was crowded with customers. The sheds and shops at the end of the market grew every moment more distinct, and a railway van, laden with carrots, came rumbling into the yard. The pigeons, too, began to fly into the sheds, or walk about the paving-stones, and the gas-man came round with his ladder to turn out the lamps. Then every one was pushing about, the children crying as their naked feet were trodden upon, and the women hurrying off with their baskets or shawls filled with cresses, and the bunch of rushes in their hands. In one corner of the market, busily tying up their bunches, were three or four girls, seated on the stones, with their legs curled up under them, and the ground near them was green with the leaves they had thrown away. A saleswoman, seeing me looking at the group, said, 'Ah, you should come here of a summer's morning, and then you'd see 'em, sitting tying up, young and old, upwards of a hundred poor things, as thick as crows in a ploughed field.'\"|[2]|References|[|edit|]|^|Fann Court \u2013 Farthing Alley|,|A Dictionary of London|(1918).

Hungerford Inn, or seemingly the burned-out remains of it, was subdivided into shops and with a covered|piazza|, formed the market.|[2]|The market never prospered|[4]|and Hungerford sold the site in parcels to the politician Sir|Stephen Fox|between 1681 and 1684, and Sir|Christopher Wren|bought a quarter of the property, and a quarter of the rents.|[2]|In 1685 Fox and Wren obtained a license to sell grain, but achieved little increase in trade. A market house was built in the centre of the site, possibly designed by Wren himself.|[4]|Hungerford squandered his money, dying a poor|Knight of Windsor|in 1711. In 1718 the  market was sold to the royal gardener|Henry Wise|and remained in his family until 1830, when it was bought by the newly formed Hungerford Market Company.|[2]|New market|[|edit|]|By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the old market had become dilapidated.|[2]|In 1830 an|Act of Parliament|was obtained to|incorporate|a company to re-establish the market. The company acquired the site of the old market, together with the adjoining houses in Hungerford street, and a few in the Strand.|[5]|All the existing buildings were demolished, and a new structure was built in 1831-3 to an|Italianate|design by|Charles Fowler|, the architect of|Covent Garden Market|.  The building contract was the first undertaken by the partnership of|Grissell and Peto|, who later went on to build|Nelson's Column|, the|Reform Club|, and the|Lyceum Theatre|,|[2]|The buildings were mostly of granite.|[5]|The area occupied by the new market was a strip 126 feet wide, extending 465 feet northward towards the Strand. In addition, next to the river, was a wharf, about 200 feet long, with  steps down to the water. The market itself was divided into three sections. The lower level  of the site was occupied by a fish market,  consisting of an open court, 130 feet long, with two tiers of colonnaded galleries on each side.|[6]|By 1830 the replacement of|Old London Bridge|meant that fishing boats could then come further upstream to deliver their catch,|[4]|and the company hoped to break the monopoly of|Billingsgate Market|by providing a more convenient supply of fish for the West End.|[6]|Fowler later built an iron roof over the open court to protect the fishmongers' stalls|[6]|and two end pavilions towards the river were used as taverns.|[5]|At the northern end of this lower court  a flight of steps led to the upper level, which was elevated over storage vaults. The Great Hall, an aisled timber-roofed  building 160 feet long, housed a fruit and vegetable market. To the north of that was another open court, flanked by colonnades  and butchers' shops. New Hungerford Street led from there into the Strand. Fowler exploited the complexities of the site for dramatic effect, leading|Thomas Leverton Donaldson|to talk of \"the playful picturesqueness of the group, where court rose above court, galleries above galleries, and where the series of roofs outtopped each other.\"|[6]|A|suspension bridge|leading to the market from|Lambeth|on the south bank of the River Thames was built by|Isambard Kingdom Brunel|in 1845, and a hall for lectures, named|Hungerford Hall|, was built next-door in 1851.  In the same year of 1851, the  Swiss-Italian entrepreneur|Carlo Gatti|opened a stand at the market selling pastries and|ice cream|, priced at one penny  and served in a shell. This was perhaps the first time that ice cream was made available to the paying general public.|[2]|Demolition|[|edit|]|The market  found itself unable to challenge more specialist markets, such as|Billingsgate|, and|Covent Garden|, and  was badly damaged when Hungerford Hall burned down in 1854. It was sold to the|South Eastern Railway|in 1862 which demolished it to make way for|Charing Cross railway station|, which opened on 11 January 1864. Brunel's  suspension bridge was replaced with the new nine-span|Hungerford Railway Bridge|, and its chains  were re-used to complete the|Clifton Suspension Bridge|in|Bristol|.|Vestiges|[|edit|]|The Hungerford family are commemorated in the name of the|Hungerford Bridge|, which leads into Charing Cross from the south bank of the River Thames.|See also|[|edit|]|Market (place)|Retail|References|[|edit|]|^|25 April/26 April 1669.|Samuel Pepys Diary April 1669|^|a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|Charing Cross, the railway stations, and Old Hungerford Market|, Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 123-134|accessed: October 15, 2007|^|Position in north wall as stated in Edward Walford, 1878, p.131|^|a|b|c|Gater, Sir George and Godfrey, Walter H.

Significant changes to the buildings have been made over the years as a result of successive expansions to the nearby railway infrastructure; see|\"Railway viaducts and the Thameslink Programme\"|.|A refurbishment began in 2001. The Work  includes the re-erection in 2004 of the South Portico from the Floral Hall, previously at|Covent Garden|, which was dismantled when the|Royal Opera House|was reconstructed in the 1990s.|[5]|The original Convent Garden building was|listed|and the resited portico was Grade II listed in 2008.|[13]|Borough Market circa 1860|Art Deco 1932 Southwark Street entrance|South Portico from the Floral Hall (erected 2004)|Trade|[|edit|]|The present-day market mainly sells|speciality foods|to the general public. However, in the 20th century, it was essentially a wholesale market, selling produce in quantity to greengrocers. It was the main supplier, along with Covent Garden, of fruits and vegetables to retail greengrocers' shops. Amongst the notable businesses trading in the market were|Vitacress|, Lee Brothers (potato merchants whose signage can still be seen in the market), Manny Sugarman,  AW Bourne and Eddy Robbins. JO Sims, the main importer for South African citrus fruit (Outspan), were also located in the market.|Vegetable stall|Stallholders come to trade at the market from different parts of the|UK|, and traditional European products are also imported and sold. Amongst the produce on sale are fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, meat, game, baked bread and pastries.|The market is a|charitable trust|administered by a board of volunteer|trustees|, who have to live in the area.|[14]|Borough Market and the surrounding streets have been used as a film location for such features as|Bridget Jones's Diary|(2001),|Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels|(1998) and|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|(2004).|[15]|More recently some scenes in|The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus|(2009) were shot there.|[16]|As reported by the|London Evening Standard|, the market is available to hire for private events.|[17]|Railway viaducts and the Thameslink Programme|[|edit|]|Main article:|Thameslink Programme|From 1860, the railway operating companies desired to extend services from|London Bridge station|into new stations at|Cannon Street|and|Blackfriars|in the|City|and link to the|West End|at|Charing Cross Station|. This required a viaduct, but legally, it was impossible by the 1756 Borough Market Act for the Trustees to alienate their property. The compromise was that only a|flying leasehold|was given to the railway company for the permanent way, but only for as long as a railway operates on it. The Market continues to trade underneath the arches of the viaduct. Each time there is a railway expansion requiring widening of the viaduct, the Trustees receive a full compensation payment.|[18]|First span of the new Borough Market viaduct at Stoney Street|Most recently, as part of the|Thameslink Programme|, a large number of listed buildings in the Borough Market area have been altered or demolished.|[19]|The market building on Bedale Street south-side has had its upper floors removed, as has the|Wheatsheaf public house|on Stoney Street, for the new railway bridge to cross over them. The remaining floors have been re-occupied. The old Market glazed roof on Stoney Street has been re-instated and cleaned. A significant loss was the Smirke Terrace, Nos 16\u201326 Borough High Street, demolished in 2010.|[20]|See also|[|edit|]|Farmers' market|References|[|edit|]|^|\"Food markets in London\"|.|Visitlondon.com|.

By 1976, when plans for the motorway were abandoned, the market had become a well known feature of|Camden Town|. Originally, the Lock was a market for crafts, occupying some outdoor areas by the canal and various existing buildings.|While the range of goods has since widened, with stalls selling books, new and second-hand clothing, and jewellery, the Lock retains its focus as the principal Camden market for crafts. There is a large selection of fast food stalls. In 1991 a three-storey indoor market hall designed by architect John Dickinson was opened on the site of the first outdoor market. In the style of the traditional 19th century industrial architecture and housing in the area, it is built of brick and cast iron. It attracted large numbers of visitors partly due to stalls being open on Sundays, when previous to the|Sunday Trading Act 1994|, shops were not permitted to operate on Sundays. On 28 February 1993, the|Provisional IRA|exploded a bomb hidden in a litter bin on Camden High Street near the market, shortly after lunchtime. The bomb injured 11 people.|[6]|[7]|From 2006, a large indoor market hall was constructed in a yard between the Camden Lock Market and the Stables Market that was previously used for open air stalls. In November 2007 a large part of the Stables Market was demolished as part of a long-term redevelopment plan for the area and rebuilt as a year-round permanent market area.|In 2016, Urban Markets Company acquired Camden Lock and paid between \u00a3300m and \u00a3400m for the one-acre site. The joint venture between the founders of Camden Lock and Millitarne Retail Resorts International, the retail developers, was financed by Brockton Capital, a real estate private equity fund.|[8]|Camden Lock Market is set to have a \u00a320\u2009million makeover to transform it into a traditional arts and craft centre for Londoners. The Urban Market Company plans to double the enclosed area and increase trading space by 15,000 square feet.|[9]|2017 fire|[|edit|]|Wikinews has related news:|London's Camden Market in flames|Early on 10 July 2017, shortly after midnight, a large fire (cause currently unknown) occurred at the Camden Lock Market. At least 70 firefighters and 10 engines attended.|[10]|[11]|Stables Market|[|edit|]|The Stables Market was owned by|Bebo Kobo|,|Richard Caring|and Elliot Bernerd of Chelsfield Partners until 2014. It was sold in 2014 for $685\u00a0million and is owned today by Market Tech PLC, a UK AIM listed public company. The market is located in the historic former|Pickfords|stables and Grade II|listed|[12]|horse hospital which served the horses pulling Pickford's distribution vans and barges along the canal. Many of the stalls and shops are set in large arches in railway viaducts.|Chain stores are not permitted and trade is provided by a mixture of small enclosed and outdoor shops and stalls, of which some are permanent, and others hired by the day. In common with most of the other Camden markets the Stables Market has many clothes stalls. It is also the main focus for furniture in the markets. Household goods, decorative, ethnically-influenced items, and second-hand items or 20th-century antiques, many of them hand-crafted, are among the wares. There are also clothing and art pieces for alternative sub-cultures, such as|goths|and|cybergoths|. These shops include Black Rose, which caters for goths, with items such as coffin-shaped handbags, and|Cyberdog|, which houses much cyber-style \"neon\"|PVC|and rubber clothing.|During the weeks before Christmas 2004, radio DJ and TV presenter|Chris Evans|sold many of his possessions, ranging from sofas to TVs and crockery, on a stall in the Stables Market.|[13]|The Stables Market entrance|Horse Tunnel Market in August 2012|In October 2006 a large indoor market hall was built in a yard between the Stables Market and Camden Lock Market that was previously used for temporary open-air stalls. In the summer of 2007 redevelopment of the back of the Stables Market took place. This redevelopment consisted of two new four-storey buildings housing shops, food outlets, offices, workshops and storage facilities, as well as an exhibition space. The redevelopment included a new pedestrian route through the rear of the Stables Market exposing 25 of the existing railway arches. Pedestrian walkways\u2014in the style of the existing historic ramp and bridge system\u2014has opened up the site and increased access for visitors. A glass roof and cycle parking spaces has also been added.|[14]|On 19 May 2014, at around 8:00|p.m.|, a fire broke out at the Camden Stables Market on Chalk Farm Road where a reported 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters dealt with the blaze. No injuries were reported by the London Ambulance Service and the London Fire Brigade announced that the fire had been controlled since 9:00|p.m.|[15]|Hawley Wharf, previously Canal Market and Camden Lock Village|[|edit|]|The view of the Camden Lock Village from the bridge over|Regent's Canal|prior to redevelopment|Owned by Bebo Kobo and|OD Kobo|, Camden Lock Village was the section along the canal to the east of|Chalk Farm Road|was known as the Canal Market and had a covered entrance tunnel leading into a general outdoor market. The market was devastated by fire on 9 February 2008 caused by unauthorised use of a liquified petroleum gas heater.|[16]|After crossing the railway line, the fire badly damaged the rear of the Hawley Arms on Castlehaven Road.|[17]|The market reopened in May 2009 as the Camden Lock Village.|[18]|The cover over the original street entrance was removed, and a new entrance created near the railway bridge.|The market closed in early 2015, to be redeveloped over several years at a cost exceeding \u00a3500m as Hawley Wharf.|[19]|The stalls were replaced by a four-storey covered structure, with units housing sixty fast-food providers, 150 shops, and co-working offices. The development also provided 200 homes. Hawley Wharf's sites started opening in 2021.|[20]|Buck Street Market|[|edit|]|The Buck Street Market was an outdoor market focusing on clothes. There is no formal or legal definition of Camden Market; the Buck Street Market's sign read 'The Camden Market'. A few stallholders designed their own wares, while at the weekend these designs were more likely to be found in the Electric Ballroom market.|The market closed in its existing form, initially during later postponed plans to rebuild|Camden Town tube station|.|[21]|It reopened as a multi-floor structure.|Electric Ballroom|[|edit|]|The|Electric Ballroom|on|Camden High Street|has been a night club since the 1950s. The weekend market had been operating here for at least 24 years but closed at short notice in 2015, leaving many staff and traders unemployed.|Inverness Street Market|[|edit|]|A small street market has operated in|Inverness Street|near Camden Town Tube station since the late 19th century, mostly selling produce, rather than ready-to-eat food, until the 21st century. It started losing its traditional stalls once local supermarkets opened, a trend accelerated by the closing of a nearby bus stop which facilitated access;|[22]|by mid-2013 all the original stalls had been replaced by \"touristy\" stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce.|Ownership|[|edit|]|The markets were originally a collection of stalls on land with various owners, evolving into a 6.5-hectare (16-acre) patchwork of more than 1,000 stalls, bars, shops, and cafes.|In 2014, Israeli billionaire|Teddy Sagi|started buying property in the Camden Market area.|[3]|By March 2015, having purchased the four most important of the six sections of the market, he announced plans to invest \u00a3300\u00a0million in developing the market area by 2018. The markets, initially a collection of simple stalls plus the Stables building, were heavily developed with permanent structures. In 2022 they were offered for sale with|investment bank|Rothschild & Co|overseeing the sale process, the owner hoping for a price of around \u00a31.5 billion for the markets plus housing, co-working spaces, 3,300-square-metre (35,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft)|[4]|[5]|and a three-floor leisure centre called Babylon Park.|[23]|See also|[|edit|]|Camden Catacombs|Markets in London|Portobello Road|References|[|edit|]|^|More for less (26 October 2003).|\"Crashes and near misses could derail the privatised Tube\"|.|news.independent.co.uk|.

The market closed in 1886, after use as warehouses and small workshops. Prompted by|Charles Dickens|, Angela Burdett-Coutts also built the separate U-shaped Columbia Dwellings, of several storeys, with a three-storey Gothic arch built into the brickwork of the central section. The building was demolished in 1958,|[6]|although the remains of railings can be seen in front of the Nursery School.|Sivill House|and the Dorset Estate replaced the Coutts buildings.|Columbia Market in the|Illustrated London News|, 1869|Recent history|[|edit|]|The Columbia Road flower market began as a Saturday trading market. It was moved to Sunday, by|Act of Parliament|, in order to accommodate the needs of local|Jewish|traders. This also provided the opportunity for|Covent Garden|and|Spitalfields|traders to sell their stock left over from Saturday. The enduring interest and demand for|cut flowers|and plants were introduced to the|East End|by|Huguenot|immigrants (driven from France after 1685 by the|revocation of the Edict of Nantes|), together with a fascination for caged songbirds|[7]|\u2013 the pub at the end of the market is called The Birdcage.|The market suffered in|World War II|from rules prioritising|food production|, and went into a long decline. A large civilian shelter beneath the market suffered a direct hit by a 50\u00a0kg bomb on the night of Saturday, 7 September 1940, at the height of|The Blitz|.|[8]|From the 1960s, new rules forced traders to attend regularly, and the market enjoyed a new resurgence with the increasing popularity of gardening programmes.|Modern market|Columbia Road on a weekday morning.

The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by|University of Greenwich|and|Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance|.|The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there, such as|Vanbrugh Castle|(1717) established on Maze Hill, next to the park. From the|Georgian period|estates of houses were constructed above the town centre. The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century, with the siting of the|Cutty Sark|and|Gipsy Moth IV|next to the river front, and the|National Maritime Museum|in the former buildings of the|Royal Hospital School|in 1934.|Historically an|ancient parish|in the|Blackheath Hundred|of Kent, the town formed part of the growing|conurbation|of|London|in the 19th century. When the|County of London|, an|administrative area|designed to replace the|Metropolitan Board of Works|, was formed in 1889, the parish merged with those of|Charlton-next-Woolwich|,|Deptford St Nicholas|and|Kidbrooke|to create the|Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich|. When local government in London was again|reformed in 1965|, it merged with most of the|Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich|, creating what is now the|Royal Borough of Greenwich|, a|local authority district|of Greater London.|History|[|edit|]|Toponymy|[|edit|]|The place-name 'Greenwich' is first attested in an|Anglo-Saxon charter|of 918, where it appears as|Gronewic|. It is recorded as|Grenewic|in 964, and as|Grenawic|in the|Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|for 1013. It is|Grenviz|in the|Domesday Book|of 1086, and|Grenewych|in the|Taxatio Ecclesiastica|of 1291. The name means 'green|wic'|, indicating that Greenwich was what is known as a|-wich town|or|emporium|,  from the Latin '|vicus|'.|[3]|The settlement later became known as|East Greenwich|to distinguish it from|West Greenwich|or|Deptford Strond|, the part of|Deptford|adjacent to the|River Thames|,|[4]|but the use of|East Greenwich|to mean the whole of the town of Greenwich died out in the 19th century. However, Greenwich was divided into the registration subdistricts of|Greenwich East|and|Greenwich West|from the beginning of|civil registration|in 1837, the boundary running down what is now|Greenwich Church Street|and|Croom's Hill|, although more modern references to \"|East|\" and \"|West|\" Greenwich probably refer to the areas east and west of the|Royal Naval College|and|National Maritime Museum|corresponding with the West Greenwich|council ward|. An article in|The Times|of 13 October 1967 stated:|[5]|East Greenwich|, gateway to the|Blackwall Tunnel|, remains solidly|working class|, the manpower for one eighth of London's|heavy industry|.|West Greenwich|is a hybrid: the spirit of Nelson, the|Cutty Sark|, the Maritime Museum, an industrial waterfront and a number of elegant houses, ripe for development.|Manor of East Greenwich|[|edit|]|Royal charters|granted to English colonists in North America,|[6]|as well as in|Company Bombay|and|St Helena|,|[7]|often used the name of the|manor|of East Greenwich for describing the tenure (from the Latin verb|teneo|, hold) as that of free|socage|.|[8]|New England|charters provided that the grantees should hold their lands \"as of his Majesty's manor of East Greenwich\". This was in relation to the principle of land tenure under English law, that the ruling monarch (king or queen) was paramount lord of all the soil in the|terra regis|,|[9]|while all others held their lands, directly or indirectly, under the monarch. Land outside the physical boundaries of England, as in America, was treated as belonging constructively to one of the existing royal manors, and from Tudor times grants frequently used the name of the manor of East Greenwich,|[10]|but some 17th-century grants named|the castle of Windsor|.|[11]|[12]|[13]|Places in North America that have taken the name \"East Greenwich\" include a township in|Gloucester County, New Jersey|, a hamlet in|Washington County, New York|, and a town in|Kent County, Rhode Island|.|Greenwich, Connecticut|was also named after Greenwich.|Early settlement|[|edit|]|Prehistoric burial mounds in Greenwich Park|Tumuli|to the south-west of Flamsteed House,|[14]|in|Greenwich Park|, are thought to be early|Bronze Age|barrows re-used by the Saxons in the 6th century as burial grounds. To the east between the Vanbrugh and Maze Hill Gates is the site of a Roman villa or temple. A small area of red paving|tesserae|protected by railings marks the spot. It was excavated in 1902 and 300 coins were found dating from the emperors|Claudius|and|Honorius|to the 5th century. This was excavated by the|Channel 4|television programme|Time Team|in 1999, broadcast in 2000,|[15]|and further investigations were made by the same group in 2003.|[16]|The|Roman road|from London to|Dover|,|Watling Street|crossed the high ground to the south of Greenwich, through Blackheath. This followed the line of an earlier|Celtic|route from|Canterbury|to|St Albans|.|[17]|As late as|Henry V|, Greenwich was only a fishing town, with a safe anchorage in the river.|[4]|Viking|[|edit|]|During the reign of|Ethelred the Unready|, the|Danish|fleet anchored in the River Thames off Greenwich for over three years, with the army being encamped on the hill above. From here they attacked|Kent|and, in the year 1012, took the city of|Canterbury|, making Archbishop|Alphege|their prisoner for seven months in their camp at Greenwich, at that time within the county of Kent. They stoned him to death for his refusal to allow his ransom (3,000 pieces of silver) to be paid; and kept his body, until the blossoming of a stick that had been immersed in his blood. For this miracle his body was released to his followers, he achieved sainthood for his martyrdom and, in the 12th century, the parish church was dedicated to him. The present church on the site west of the town centre is|St Alfege's Church|, designed by|Nicholas Hawksmoor|in 1714 and completed in 1718.|Norman|[|edit|]|The|Domesday Book|of 1086 records the manor of|Grenviz|in the|hundred|of|Grenviz|as held by Bishop|Odo of Bayeux|;|[18]|his lands were seized by the crown in 1082. The name of the hundred was changed to|Blackheath|when the site of the hundred court was moved there in the 12th century. A royal palace, or hunting lodge, has existed here since before 1300, when|Edward I|is known to have made offerings at the chapel of the Virgin Mary.|[19]|Plantagenet|[|edit|]|Subsequent monarchs were regular visitors, with|Henry IV|making his will here, and|Henry V|granting the manor (for life) to|Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter|, who died at Greenwich in 1426. The palace was created by|Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|, Henry V's half-brother and the regent to|Henry VI|in 1447; he enclosed the park and erected a tower (|Greenwich Castle|) on the hill now occupied by the|Royal Observatory|. The Thames-side palace was renamed the|Palace of Placentia|or Pleasaunce by|Henry VI|'s consort|Margaret of Anjou|after Humphrey's death. The palace was completed and further enlarged by|Edward IV|, and in 1466 it was granted to his queen,|Elizabeth|.|[19]|In 1485, Edward IV established a|Franciscan|friary|of|Observant Friars|in Greenwich after being given permission by the Pope; the first Observant House in England, it was located on land adjacent to the palace.|[20]|After rejecting papal authority in 1534, the Franciscan Observants were suppressed; refounded as Franciscan Conventual, the friary was dissolved in 1538, then re-established in 1555 for Observants, before the friars were finally expelled in 1559 and the friary was demolished in 1662.|[20]|Ultimately it was because the palace and its grounds were a royal possession (with a useful hill) that it was chosen as the site for|Charles II|'s Royal Observatory, from which stemmed Greenwich's subsequent global role as originator of the modern|Prime Meridian|.|Tudor|[|edit|]|The palace was the principal residence of|Henry VII|whose sons Henry (later|Henry VIII|) and|Edmund Tudor|were born here, and baptised in St Alphege's. Henry favoured Greenwich over nearby|Eltham Palace|, the former principal royal palace in south London, but which was not on the|River Thames|and so was less accessible. Henry extended Greenwich Palace and it became his principal London seat until|Whitehall Palace|was built in the 1530s. Henry VIII married|Catherine of Aragon|and|Anne of Cleves|at Greenwich, and both|Mary|(18 February 1516) and|Elizabeth|(7 September 1533) were born at Greenwich. His son|Edward VI|also died there at age 15.|The palace of Placentia, in turn, became Elizabeth's favourite summer residence.|[19]|Both she and her sister Mary used the palace extensively, and Elizabeth's Council planned the|Spanish Armada|campaign there in 1588.|Stuart|[|edit|]|Adriaen van Stalbemt|'s|A View of Greenwich|,|c.|1632|, showing|King Charles I|(in the black hat) and his family.|Greenwich Palace|can be seen in front of the|River Thames|behind them.|Royal Collection|, London.|James I|carried out the final remodelling work on Greenwich Palace, granting the manor to his wife|Queen Anne of Denmark|. In 1616 Anne commissioned|Inigo Jones|to design and build the surviving|Queen's House|as the final addition to the palace.|Charles I|granted the manor to his wife|Queen Henrietta Maria|, for whom Inigo Jones completed the Queen's House. During the|English Civil War|, the palace was used as a biscuit factory and prisoner-of-war camp. Then, in the|Interregnum|, the palace and park were seized to become a 'mansion' for the|Lord Protector|.|By the time of the|Restoration|, the Palace of Placentia had fallen into disuse and was pulled down. New buildings began to be established as a grand palace for|Charles II|, but only the King Charles block was completed. Charles II also redesigned and replanted|Greenwich Park|and founded and built the|Royal Observatory|.|Prince James (later King|James II & VII|), as|Duke of York|and|Lord Admiral|until 1673, was often at Greenwich with his brother Charles and, according to|Samuel Pepys|, he proposed the idea of creating a Royal Naval Hospital. This was eventually established at Greenwich by his daughter|Mary II|, who in 1692\u20131693 commissioned|Christopher Wren|to design the Royal Hospital for Seamen (now the|Old Royal Naval College|). The work was begun under her widower|William III|in 1696 and completed by|Hawksmoor|.|Queen Anne|and|Prince George of Denmark|continued to patronise the project.|Hanoverian|[|edit|]|George I|landed at Greenwich from Hanover on his accession in 1714. His successor|George II|granted the Royal Hospital for Seamen the forfeited estates of the|Jacobite|Earl of Derwentwater|, which allowed the building to be completed by 1751.|In 1805,|George III|granted the|Queen's House|to the|Royal Naval Asylum|(an orphanage school), which amalgamated in 1821\u20131825 with the Greenwich Hospital School. Extended with the buildings that now house the|National Maritime Museum|, it was renamed the|Royal Hospital School|by|Queen Victoria|in 1892.|George IV|donated nearly 40 paintings to the hospital in 1824, at a stroke creating a gallery in the|Painted Hall|. These now form the Greenwich Hospital Collection at the National Maritime Museum. Subsequently,|William IV|and|Queen Adelaide|were both regular donors and visitors to the gallery.|Victorian and Edwardian|[|edit|]|In the 1880s, if this place is so cut into three: east, central and west zones of about 30,000 inhabitants each, the central one had less than 10% recognisable poverty, the minimum of London's map above, but the others (east and west) more than 40%.|Queen Victoria|rarely visited Greenwich, but in 1845 her husband|Prince Albert|personally bought|Nelson's|Trafalgar|coat for the Naval Gallery.|In 1838 the|London and Greenwich Railway|(L&GR) completed the very first steam railway in London. It started at London Bridge and had its terminus at London Street (now Greenwich High Road). It was also the first to be built specifically for passengers, and the first ever elevated railway, having 878 arches over its almost four mile stretch. South of the railway's viaduct over|Deptford Creek|is a Victorian|pumping station|constructed in 1864 as part of Sir|Joseph Bazalgette|'s|London sewerage system|(the Southern Outfall Sewer flows under Greenwich town centre).|In 1853 the local Scottish Presbyterian community built a church, St Mark's, nearby which was extended twice in the 1860s during the ministry of|Adolph Saphir|, eventually accommodating 1,000 worshippers.|[21]|[22]|In 1864 opposite the railway terminus, theatrical entrepreneur|Sefton Parry|built the thousand seater|New Greenwich Theatre|.|[23]|William Morton|was one of its more successful managers. The theatre was demolished in 1937 to make way for a new|Town Hall|, now a listed building under new ownership and renamed Meridian House.|[24]|Greenwich Station is at the northern apex of the Ashburnham Triangle, a residential estate developed by the Ashburnham family, mainly between 1830 and 1870, on land previously developed as market gardens. It is now a designated conservation area.|[25]|The present Greenwich Theatre, further to the east, on|Croom's Hill|, was constructed inside the shell of a Victorian music hall. Beginning life in 1855 as an annexe to the Rose and Crown, the music hall was rebuilt in 1871 by Charles Crowder and subsequently operated under many names. Further south on Croom's Hill, the Roman Catholic church of|Our Ladye Star of the Sea|was opened in 1851.|[26]|The meridian was established in 1851.|Modern and the present|[|edit|]|George V|and|Queen Mary|both supported the creation of the|National Maritime Museum|, and Mary presented the museum with many items.|The Prince Albert,|Duke of York|(later|George VI|), laid the foundation stone of the new|Royal Hospital School|when it moved out to|Holbrook|, Suffolk. In 1937 his first public act as king (three weeks before coronation) was to open the National Maritime Museum in the buildings vacated by the school. The king was accompanied by his mother Queen Mary, his wife Queen Elizabeth (later|Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|) and the Princess Elizabeth (later|Elizabeth II|.)|Princess Elizabeth and her consort|Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|(who was ennobled|Baron Greenwich|on marriage in 1947) made their first public and official visit to Greenwich in 1948 to receive the Freedom of the Borough for Philip. In the same year, he became a trustee of the National Maritime Museum. Prince Philip was a trustee for 52 years until 2000, when he became its first|patron|. The Duke of Edinburgh was also a patron of the|Cutty Sark|(which was opened by the Queen in 1957) from 1952.|During the|Silver Jubilee|of 1977, the Queen embarked at Greenwich for the Jubilee River Pageant. In 1987, she was aboard the|P&O|ship|Pacific Princess|when it moored alongside the|Old Royal Naval College|for the company's 150th-anniversary celebrations.|To mark the|Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|, it was announced on 5 January 2010 that on 3 February 2012 the|London Borough of Greenwich|would become the fourth to have Royal Borough status, the others being the|Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|, the|Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|and the|Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead|.|[27]|The status was granted in recognition of the borough's historic links with the|Royal Family|, the location of the|Prime Meridian|and its being a|UNESCO World Heritage Site|.|[28]|Governance|[|edit|]|Main article:|Royal Borough of Greenwich|The former|Greenwich Town Hall|, now known as \"Meridian House\"|A map showing the wards of Greenwich Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.|Greenwich is covered by the Greenwich West and Peninsula wards of the London Borough of Greenwich, which was formed in 1965 by merging the former|Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich|with that part of the|Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich|which lay south of the|River Thames|.

To the south, the land rises steeply, 100 feet (30\u00a0m) through Greenwich Park to the town of|Blackheath|. The higher areas consist of a sedimentary layer of gravelly soils, known as the|Blackheath Beds|, that spread through much of the south-east over a chalk outcrop\u2014with sands, loam and seams of clay at the lower levels by the river.|Greenwich is bordered by|Deptford Creek|and|Deptford|to the west; the residential area of|Westcombe Park|to the east; the|River Thames|to the north; and the|A2|and Blackheath to the south.

The nearby Trafalgar Rowing Centre in Crane Street is home to|Curlew|and|Globe|rowing clubs.|The|Old Royal Naval College|is Sir|Christopher Wren|'s domed masterpiece at the centre of the heritage site. The site is administered by the Greenwich Foundation and several of the buildings are let to the|University of Greenwich|and one, the King Charles block, to|Trinity College of Music|. Within the complex is the former college dining room, the|Painted Hall|, this was painted by|James Thornhill|, and the|Chapel of St Peter and St Paul|, with an interior designed by|James 'Athenian' Stuart|. The Naval College had a training reactor, the|JASON reactor|, within the King William building that was operational between 1962 and 1996. The reactor was decommissioned and removed in 1999.|[37]|Trinity Hospital, Greenwich|To the east of the Naval College is the|Trinity Hospital|almshouse, founded in 1613, the oldest surviving building in the town centre.|[38]|This is next to the massive brick walls and the landing stage of|Greenwich Power Station|. Built between 1902 and 1910 as a coal-fired station to supply power to|London's tram system|, and later the|London underground|, it is now oil- and gas-powered and serves as a backup station for London Underground.|[39]|East Greenwich also has a small park,|East Greenwich Pleasaunce|, which was formerly the burial ground of Greenwich Hospital.|The O|2|(formerly the|Millennium Dome|) was built on part of the site of|East Greenwich Gas Works|, a disused|British Gas|site on the|Greenwich Peninsula|.|[40]|It is next to|North Greenwich Underground station|, about 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) north east from the Greenwich town centre, north west of|Charlton|. Pear Tree Wharf was associated with the gas works, being used to unload coal for the manufacturing of town gas, and is now home to the|Greenwich Yacht Club|. The|Greenwich Millennium Village|is a modern|urban regeneration|development to the south of the Dome.|Enderby's Wharf|is a site associated with|submarine cable|manufacture for over 150 years.|Greenwich Park|[|edit|]|Main article:|Greenwich Park|South of the former Naval College is the|National Maritime Museum|housed in buildings forming another symmetrical group and grand arcade incorporating the|Queen's House|, designed by|Inigo Jones|. Continuing to the south,|Greenwich Park|is a|Royal Park|of 183 acres (0.7\u00a0km|2|), laid out in the 17th century and formed from the hunting grounds of the Royal|Palace of Placentia|.|[41]|Spiral staircase and lantern at the|Queen's House|in Greenwich|The park rises towards|Blackheath|and at the top of this hill is a statue of|James Wolfe|, commander of the British expedition to capture|Quebec|.|[42]|Nearby a major group of buildings within the park includes the former|Royal Observatory, Greenwich|; the|Prime Meridian|passes through this building.|Greenwich Mean Time|was at one time based on the time observations made at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, before being superseded by the closely-related|Coordinated Universal Time|(UTC). While there is no longer a working astronomical observatory at Greenwich, a|ball|still drops daily to mark the exact moment of 1\u00a0p.m., and there is a museum of astronomical and navigational tools, particularly|John Harrison|'s|marine chronometers|.|[43]|The|Ranger's House|lies at the Blackheath end of the park and houses the Wernher Collection of art,|[44]|and many fine houses, including|Vanbrugh's house|lie on Maze Hill, on the western edge of the park.|Town centre|[|edit|]|Town centre|Around the covered Greenwich Market, Georgian and Victorian architecture dominates in the town centre which spreads to the west of the park and Royal Naval College. Up the hill from the centre, there are many streets of Georgian houses, including the|Fan Museum|, on Croom's Hill. Nearby at the junction of Croom's Hill with Nevada Street, is|Greenwich Theatre|. The arthouse Greenwich Cinema is on Greenwich High Road, while the nearby|Greenwich Playhouse|closed in 2012.|Market|[|edit|]|Greenwich Market|There has been a market at Greenwich since the 14th century, but the history of the present market dates from 1700 when a charter to run two markets, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, was assigned by Lord Romney (|Henry, Earl of Romney|)|[19]|to the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital for 1000 years.|[45]|The market is part of \"the island site\", bounded by College Approach, Greenwich Church Street,|King William Walk|and Nelson Road, near the National Maritime Museum and the Royal Observatory. The buildings surrounding the market are|Grade 2 listed|and were established in 1827\u20131833 under the direction of|Joseph Kay|.|[46]|[47]|A market roof was added in 1902\u20131908 (and replaced in 2016). Later significant development occurred in 1958\u20131960 and during the 1980s.|The landowner, Greenwich Hospital, enhanced the market between 2014 and early 2016. Following the|COVID-19 pandemic|in 2020 the rents for several of the market stalls were increased by up to 60% as Greenwich Hospital's managing agent|Knight Frank|said it was losing money with fewer stalls operating and only four days of trading a week.|[48]|Millennium Leisure Park|[|edit|]|Millennium Leisure Park|About 1.0 mile (1.6\u00a0km) east of Greenwich town centre, the Millennium Leisure Park is an out-of-town|retail park|on Bugsby's Way in east Greenwich. It consists of retail outlets (|IKEA|and|B&Q|), restaurants and an|Odeon|cinema. The IKEA store here opened in 2019 as the retailer's fourth main store in London,|[49]|following stores in|Wembley|(1988),|Croydon|(1992) and|Tottenham|(2005); the Greenwich store is the first in|Inner London|.|[50]|Greenwich Shopping Park is about 0.5 miles (0.8\u00a0km) further east, in|Charlton|.|Greenwich Mean Time|[|edit|]|Main article:|Greenwich Mean Time|Royal Observatory with the|time ball|atop the Octagon Room|Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a term originally referring to|mean solar time|at the|Royal Observatory, Greenwich|in Greenwich.  It is commonly used in practice to refer to|Coordinated Universal Time|(UTC) when this is viewed as a|time zone|, especially by bodies connected with the United Kingdom, such as the|BBC World Service|,|[51]|the|Royal Navy|, the|Met Office|and others, although strictly UTC is an|atomic|time scale|which only approximates GMT with a tolerance of 0.9 second.  It is also used to refer to|Universal Time|(UT), which is a standard astronomical concept used in many technical fields and is often referred to by the military in the phrase|Zulu time|.|As the United Kingdom grew into an advanced|maritime nation|, British mariners kept at least one|chronometer|on GMT in order to calculate their|longitude|from the|Greenwich meridian|, which was by convention considered to have longitude zero degrees (this convention was internationally adopted in the|International Meridian Conference|of 1884).|[note 1]|The synchronization of the|chronometer|on GMT did not affect shipboard time itself, which was still solar time. But this practice, combined with mariners from other nations drawing from|Nevil Maskelyne|'s method of|lunar distances|based on observations at Greenwich, eventually led to GMT being used worldwide as a reference time independent of location. Most time zones were based upon this reference as a number of hours and half-hours \"ahead of GMT\" or \"behind GMT\".|In recognition of the suburb's astronomical links,|Asteroid 2830|has been named 'Greenwich'.|[53]|World Heritage Site|[|edit|]|UNESCO World Heritage Site|Maritime Greenwich|UNESCO World Heritage Site|Old Royal Naval College|and|University of Greenwich|buildings on the bank of the|River Thames|Location|United Kingdom|Criteria|Cultural: i, ii, iv, vi|Reference|795|Inscription|1997 (21st|Session|)|Extensions|2008|Area|109.5 hectares (271 acres)|Buffer\u00a0zone|174.85 hectares (432.1 acres)|Website|whc|.unesco|.org|/en|/list|/795|Coordinates|51\u00b029\u20321\u2033N|0\u00b00\u203221\u2033W|\ufeff / \ufeff|51.48361\u00b0N 0.00583\u00b0W|\ufeff /|51.48361; -0.00583|In 1997|Maritime Greenwich|was added to the list of|World Heritage Sites|, for the concentration and quality of buildings of historic and architectural interest.

          "|This was also where the Spanish ambassador had his house, and the area attracted many Spaniards from the reign of|James I|. Peticote Lane was severely affected by the|Great Plague|of 1665; the rich fled, and London lost a fifth of its population.|Middlesex Street Market, circa 1890|Petticoat Lane in the 1920s|Petticoat Lane in 1947|Petticoat Lane in 1971|Huguenots|fleeing persecution arrived in the late 17th century; many settled in the area, and master weavers settled in the new town of|Spitalfields|. The area already had an association with clothing, with|dyeing|a local industry. The cloth was pegged out on hooks in the surrounding fields. These were known as|tentergrounds|. From the mid-18th century, Petticoat Lane became a centre for manufacturing clothes. The market served the well-to-do in the City, selling new garments. About 1830, Peticote Lane's name changed to Middlesex Street, to record the boundary between Portsoken Ward, in the|City of London|, and|Whitechapel|, which coincided with the Lane. But the old name continues to be associated with the area.|[7]|From 1882, a wave of|Jewish|immigrants fleeing persecution in eastern Europe settled in the area. The chapels, which had previously served the Huguenot community, were adapted as synagogues. Many Jewish relief societies were founded to aid the poor.|[8]|Jewish immigrants entered the local garment industry and maintained the traditions of the market. The severe damage inflicted throughout the|East End|during|the Blitz|and later bombing in|World War II|served to disperse the Jewish communities to new areas. The area around Middlesex Street suffered a decline, but the market continued to prosper. Beginning in the 1970s, a new wave of immigration from India and east Asia restored the area's vitality - centred on nearby|Brick Lane|.|In previous times the market was unpopular with the authorities, as it was largely unregulated and in some sense illegal. As recently as the 1930s, police cars and fire engines were driven down The Lane, with alarm bells ringing, to disrupt the market. The rights of the market were finally protected by|Act of Parliament|in 1936.|[9]|As late as the 1990s, if Christmas Day fell on a Sunday (which in that decade only occurred in 1994), many of the local Jewish traders would still assert their right to open on a Sunday. 'The Lane' was always renowned for the 'patter' and showmanship of the market traders. Some, selling crockery, would pile an entire setting onto a large plate, and then send the lot, high into the air. Catching the construction on its way down was to demonstrate the skill of the vendor, and the robustness of the porcelain.|A prominent businessman,|Alan Sugar|, got his start as a stall holder in the market. The market remains busy and vibrant, reflecting both its immigrant history and its continuing popularity with locals and tourists.|Transport|[|edit|]|Aldgate East Underground station|Aldgate Underground station|Liverpool Street Station|The area is well served by buses, on Bishopsgate and Aldgate and Whitechapel High Streets|Parking restrictions apply, throughout the area, on all days of the week|Gallery|[|edit|]|Wikimedia Commons has media related to|Petticoat Lane Market|.|1947|1947|1971|2009|2010|2010|See also|[|edit|]|Marketplace|Retail|Tenterground|References|[|edit|]|^|\"National Market Traders Federation - Find a market\"|.|Nmtf.co.uk|.

          "|and Notting Hill. Its shops and markets thrived on serving the wealthy inhabitants of the elegant crescents and terraces that sprang up around it, and its working-class residents found employment in the immediate vicinity as construction workers, domestic servants, coachmen, messengers, tradesmen and costermongers. After the|Hammersmith and City Railway|line was completed in 1864, and|Ladbroke Grove station|opened, the northern end of Portobello Road was also developed, and the last of the open fields disappeared under brick and concrete.|Portobello Farm was sold to an order of nuns after the railways came in 1864.

However, there are also clothing, antique, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetable stalls throughout the week and are located further north than the antiques, near the Westway Flyover. Shops and cafes are opened daily.|The market began as many other London markets and mainly sold fresh-food in the 19th century; antiques and wares dealers arrived in the late 1940s and '50s, and gradually antiques have become the main attraction of this market, having a substantial number of them trading mainly on Saturday mornings. It is the largest antiques market in the UK.|[|citation needed|]|The market section of Portobello Road runs in a direction generally between the north-northwest and the south-south-east.

A minority of traders, mistrusting the change, continued to hold a rival Saturday cornmarket until 1892. The general provisions market continued to be held officially on Saturdays until 1874, when the Butter Market building closed; and afterwards as an unofficial Saturday street market.|[8]|Although much of the old marketplace triangle was built up by the 19th century, a small open space remained in Market Street, immediately behind the Butter Market building, and this became the main focus of street trading. However, in 1893 the entire triangle (by this date known as Middle Row) was comprehensively cleared and redeveloped by|Croydon Corporation|.|[9]|This development pushed all street trading activities into Surrey Street.|In 1922, the street market was taken over by Croydon Corporation, and relaunched as a 6-day market (Monday to Saturday), which it remains.

They were empowered to levy|rates|for paving, lighting, watching, and cleansing.|[11]|The church was rebuilt in 1849/1850 and was designated as a listed building in 1952, with the adjacent 15th/16th century Church House.|[12]|[13]|The market was the property of|the Crown|until 1828, when the manor of Havering was sold to|Hugh McIntosh|. On his death in 1840 it passed to his son David McIntosh. When David died in 1881 it passed to his widow, Charlotte McIntosh.|Romford Local Board|made several unsuccessful attempts to lease the market from Charlotte McIntosh between 1882 and 1887. There was a legal dispute between them in 1887 about the location of a|weighbridge|in the market, which the local board believed was blocking a right of way. McIntosh won the case. In 1889 the local board turned down an offer to lease the market, claiming that it was in decline. The opening of the|London, Tilbury and Southend Railway|stations at Dagenham, Hornchurch and Upminster in 1885 had made it easier to reach|Barking Market|from those communities.|[14]|Until the early 19th century the market was mostly used for the sale of cattle. By the end of that century the eastern end was used for the sale of pigs and cattle whereas at the western end farm tools, clothing, fruit and vegetables could be found.|[15]|It was a major agricultural market during the 18th and 19th centuries, with a|corn exchange|established in 1845, enlarged in 1861, and closed in 1924.|[1]|In 1892 the|Board of Agriculture|ordered the closure of the market, because of a failure to complete paving and drainage works.|[16]|It was decided at a public meeting that year for the local board to purchase the market and complete the works. The market and old court house were purchased for \u00a37,000 in 1892.|[11]|The market house building was used as offices by the Romford Local Board and then Romford Urban District Council until 1931.|[17]|It was demolished in 1933, to make way for the Quadrant Arcade.|[18]|The market gained a reputation for the|black market|sales of rationed goods during and immediately after the Second World War.|[19]|The livestock market went into decline after the Second World War.|[15]|The last sale of horses took place on 13 May 1948.|[20]|The sale of cattle in the market ended on 21 May 1958, giving way to food, clothing and household goods.|[14]|The 1965 Romford central area redevelopment plan led to the demolition of buildings to the south of the market.|[6]|The market and adjacent streets were designated a|conservation area|on 1 April 1968.|[21]|The market was located on the|high street|, the main east\u2013west road through the town.

The Street Market is managed by the|London Borough of Lambeth|.  The covered arcades have always been in private ownership, although substantial public funding was provided for their refurbishment under the Brixton Challenge grant scheme.",

It was opened by actor|Carl Brisson|on 6 May 1937. It has an interior of narrow covered streets called 'Avenues', and is double-height, similar to Market Row. There are over 100 shops. It links Coldharbour Lane, Atlantic Road and Popes Road.|The three market arcades in close proximity, forming an extensive network of stalls, are rare survivals and their special character is what marks out Brixton as distinctive from other suburban shopping centres: a mixture of history, interesting architecture,|[|according to whom?|]|the variety of goods on sale and the cultural mix of Brixton, known as the symbolic 'soul of|black Britain|'.|[|citation needed|]|Since 2011, the shops in Brixton Village and, more recently, Market Row and Reliance Arcade have been increasingly converted into cafes and restaurants, serving a wide range of different cuisines.|[4]|As a result, they are now open 8:00 am \u2013 11.30 pm every day except Monday, when they shut at 6:00 pm.|[5]|Proposed redevelopment of covered market arcades (2008\u20132009)|[|edit|]|In 2007, Market Row and Brixton Village were sold along with the other London market interests of APL Ocean Ltd to London & Associated Properties. In 2008, the new owners released proposals to redevelop the Brixton Village covered market.|[6]|The proposal included the removal of the existing building and the building of a 10-storey privately owned residential tower block and private park, above a new market building.|In January 2009, London and Associated Properties employed communications company Four Communications to undertake a survey of local opinion. Concerns were raised on the Brixton Community website|Urban 75|that the survey was one sided, only available in English.|[7]|Friends of Brixton Market, traders and residents ran a successful campaign against the proposals.|[8]|Paul Bakalite's proposal for Listing was strongly supported by the|Twentieth Century Society|. In April 2010 the Secretary of State of the Department of Culture (DCMS) announced that the government had overturned its previous decision not award heritage protection to these three arcades and declared all three Grade II|listed buildings|. They were listed by virtue of their cultural importance and contribution to the social and economic history of Brixton, particularly since the 1950s as one of the principal hearts of the Afro-Caribbean community in London, as well as for their architectural importance since such arcades, once more common, are now rare.|Controversial redevelopment plans for Brixton Arches (2016\u20132017)|[|edit|]|This section|relies excessively on|references|to|primary sources|.|Please improve this section by adding|secondary or tertiary sources|.|Find sources:|\"Brixton Market\"|\u2013|news|\u00b7|newspapers|\u00b7|books|\u00b7|scholar|\u00b7|JSTOR|(|February 2018|)|(|Learn how and when to remove this template message|)|In 2015,|Network Rail|contacted the merchants trading from the commercial premises located under the railway arches on Atlantic Road indicating plans to close those premises for a year for refurbishment|[9]|as part of the Brixton Central masterplan for redevelopment of the area.|[10]|This led to a public outcry from traders, many of whom had been occupying their retail space for decades,|[11]|claiming that this closure was an excuse to increase rents as they would be able to return to occupy the same space, but with a 350% increase of their rents.|[12]|The traders and community launched the Save Brixton Arches|[13]|campaign, which fed into the anti-gentrification movement already underway within the Brixton community|[14]|and culminated in a protest at the local council meeting where community activists declared the \"death of Brixton\" after the plans were approved.|[9]|In 2017, the majority of the arches traders ceased trading and hoardings were installed over the empty premises, but development has stalled due to complications involving the leases of two of the tenants.|[15]|During the same decade a series of properties comprosing most of Brixton Market were purchased by Hondo a company controlled by Taylor McWilliams an American investor.

          "|In the 17th century, the area through which East Street now runs was rural fields and \u2018common\u2019 land where people could graze their animals. The area to the north was known as \u2018Lock's Field\u2019 and, in 1878, was described as little more than \u2018a dreary swamp\u2019. Conditions improved and by 1881 it was recorded as a site for gypsies to stay during the winter months. To the south was Walworth Common; a popular point for the farmers of Kent and Surrey to stop overnight before making their journey into the city. People would buy produce directly from these drovers and eventually a market was established.|East Street market history|Most of the land in the area was owned by the Church, but some was eventually sold or leased. By the 1770s, some land near the junction with Old Kent Road (known then simply as The Kent Road) was cultivated as a flower nursery by the Driver family, who were also responsible for commissioning the grand buildings at nearby Surrey Square. A legal document from 1780 describes the sale of the land which led to the creation of East Street as a public highway, connecting Walworth Road with the Kent Road. By the 1800s London was expanding rapidly. Open fields were built upon and in the 1860s, Walworth Common was developed. The old markets were moved onto the Walworth Road and the vegetable sellers (Costermongers) were joined by an array of other traders. In 1875, the electric tram ran down Walworth Road bringing to an end the market. After heated negotiations with the traders, the market was split up and moved into the side streets of Westmoreland Road, East Lane and Draper Street. Draper Street was built over in the 1960s by the Elephant and Castle development. The construction of the|Aylesbury Estate|led to the decline of the Westmoreland Road market.|Charlie Chaplin blue plaque at the entrance to East Street market|Unlike the regulated market which serves the shoppers on East Street today, the original traders did not have allocated plots for their stalls. At 8am, a policeman blew a whistle and traders would rush to claim the best pitches, with shop owners on the Lane claiming the patches outside their front doors. This ended in 1927 when the licensing system was introduced. Many local men were called up in the|Second World War|and the market declined.|[2]|In 1948 it was described as \"a drab, dead thing, infinitely remote from the cockney tradition\". However, the market survived and evolved. As the population of the area has diversified so have the goods on offer and, along with the traditional fruit and vegetables, the market now sells a mix of Caribbean food, ethnic clothing, CDs and household goods.|[3]|Recently, the Walworth Society has run an animated East Street tour to share the history of the market.|[4]|East Street was likely to have been the birthplace of|Charlie Chaplin|, although no birth certificate exists. It could therefore also have been the inspiration for his similarly named 1917 seminal short film|Easy Street|, a suggestion made as early as 1928 in the film 'The Life Story of Charlie Chaplin' by Harry B. Parkinson|[5]|and reasserted in David Robinson's introduction to the most recent edition of|My Autobiography|, while the famous trousers and boots of Chaplin's trademark tramp costume may have been inspired by the every-day clothes Chaplin saw worn in what he called East Lane market.|It also features in the title sequence to the television programme|Only Fools and Horses|.|Produce|[|edit|]|The market sells inexpensive new and second-hand|clothing|,|jewellery|,|cosmetics|, household products,|confectionery|,|fruit|and|vegetables|,|CDs|and|DVDs|, shoes, bags and hats, books, cards, meat and fish. The eclectic mix of fresh food ranges from cassava to courgettes, durian fruit to eel, sheep heads to cow hooves.|Opening times|[|edit|]|The market is open every day except Monday: Tuesday to Friday 8am\u20135pm, Saturday 8am\u20136:30pm, Sunday 8am\u20132pm (though often is open until late afternoon). Saturday is the busiest day as the market consists of over 250 stalls|[6]|including the weekly plant market. A small flea market operates on Sundays near|Nursery Row Park|towards the Old Kent Road side of East Street.|Politics|[|edit|]|East street forms the boundary between two parliamentary constituencies and is therefore in the unusual position of being represented by two members of parliament. The north side of the street is in the|Bermondsey and Old Southwark|(before 2010 called|North Southwark and Bermondsey|) constituency which was represented for 32 years by|Simon Hughes|of the|Liberal Democrats|and since 2015 by|Neil Coyle|of the|Labour Party|. The south side of East Street is represented by|Harriet Harman|, the|Member of Parliament|(MP) for|Camberwell and Peckham|.|Similarly, East Street forms the boundary line between the wards of East Walworth on the north side and Faraday on the south side, both in the|London Borough of Southwark|. East Street is therefore represented in Southwark Council by six councillors, all Labour. The East Walworth councillors are Helen Morrissey, Martin Seaton and Darren Merrill. Faraday ward is represented by Dan Garfield, Lorraine Lauder and Abdul Mohammed.|East Street is under the jurisdiction of Walworth Community Council.|East Street market today|[|edit|]|East Street market 2016|Southwark has an ethnically diverse and youthful population \u2013 and the East Street market venders and shoppers reflect this diversity. Southwark has the highest proportion of residents in the UK who were born in Africa (13%), as well as a significant population from Latin America, with 75% of reception-age (4\u20135 years old) children from black and minority ethnic groups. Over 120 languages are spoken in Southwark, with 11% of households having no member of the household who has English as a first language.|[7]|Some vendors have expressed concern about the implications of the redevelopment of the surrounding area for the market.|[8]|In 2015, it was the subject of several immigration raids.|[9]|Gallery|[|edit|]|East Street market|References|[|edit|]|^|Southwark Council.|\"East Street Market\"|.

It is the United Kingdom's largest inland|fish market|. It takes its name from|Billingsgate|, a ward in the south-east corner of the|City of London|, where the riverside market was originally established. In its original location in the 19th century, Billingsgate was the largest fish market in the world.|[1]|History|[|edit|]|City of London|[|edit|]|United Kingdom legislation|Billingsgate, etc. Act 1698|Act of Parliament|Parliament of England|Long title|An Act for makeing Billingsgate a Free Market for Sale of Fish.|Citation|10 Will 3 c 13|(Ruffhead c. 24)|Dates|Royal assent|4 May 1699|Commencement|10 May 1699|Other legislation|Repealed by|Sea Fisheries Act 1868|(31 & 32 Vict c 45)",

          "|J. B. Bunning's 1852 Billingsgate Market building, which lasted for about 20 years before being redeveloped.",
          "|Jablochkoff Candles|.|[4]|The opening of the railways changed the nature of the trade, and by the late nineteenth century most of the fish arrived at the market via the|Great Eastern Railway|.|[3]|The infamously coarse language of London fishmongers made \"Billingsgate\" a byword for crude or vulgar language.|[5]|One of its earliest uses can be seen in a 1577 chronicle by|Raphael Holinshed|, where the writer makes reference to the foul tongues of Billingsgate oyster-wives. The market is depicted during|Tudor times|in|Rosemary Sutcliff|'s 1951 children's historical novel|The Armourer's House|. The writer|George Orwell|worked at Billingsgate in the 1930s, as did the|Kray twins|in the 1950s.|Poplar|[|edit|]|In 1982, the fish market was relocated to a new 13-acre (53,000\u00a0m|2|) building complex on the|Isle of Dogs|in|Poplar|, close to|Canary Wharf|and|Blackwall|. The freehold owner of the site is the|London Borough of Tower Hamlets|, but the|City of London Corporation|still runs the market; they pay an annual ground rent stipulated in an agreement between the two councils as \"the gift of one fish\".|[6]|Most of the fish sold through the market now arrives there by road, from ports as far afield as|Aberdeen|and|Cornwall|.|Billingsgate Market is open from Tuesday to Saturday. Trading commences at 4\u00a0a.m. and finishes at 8:30\u00a0a.m. Security for the market is provided by the private|Market Constabulary|.|[7]|Traditionally, the only people allowed to move fish around the market were licensed fish porters. The role dates back at least to|Henry VIII|, and was officially recognised by the|Corporation of London|in 1632. In 2012, a bitter battle was fought between modernisers and traditionalists. The modernists won and the role of the porters ended.|[8]|Future|[|edit|]|In early 2019, it was proposed in plans put forward by the Court of Common Council, the City of London Corporation\u2019s main decision-making body, that Billingsgate Fish Market,|New Spitalfields Market|, and|Smithfield Market|would move to a new consolidated site in|Dagenham Dock|,|[9]|and received outline permission in March 2021.|[10]|See also|[|edit|]|Worshipful Company of Fishmongers|References|[|edit|]|^|Dunton, Larkin (1896).|The World and Its People|.
