The duo enjoyed many hits, most memorably the 1981 single Tainted Love.|Southport-born Marc, 62, has a critically acclaimed new album out. He lives in London with his long-term partner, two parrots called Fruity and Casper, and a rescue jackdaw called Dawkins.|In his own words, Marc tells us about his childhood, his rise to fame and getting older:",
          "|Originally my name was spelt \u201cMark\u201d but I changed it to end with a \u201cc\u201d to sound more exotic, and in homage to Marc Bolan. I was a huge T.Rex fan. I often wish I\u2019d changed my surname, too.",
          "|Life changed overnight and I didn\u2019t handle fame well. Some fans became obsessive, others would be very insulting. I got threats for being different, I suppose.|Marc was made an OBE by Prince William at Buckingham Palace in 2018|(|Image:|Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire)|We had other hits and I relaxed into fame more. But we burnt out quickly. It was too much, too soon. People just wanted more Tainted Love. Dave and I agreed that if we didn\u2019t part, we\u2019d end up killing each other. So we split and I was lucky enough to enjoy success as a solo artist.|Dave and I briefly reunited in 2001 and released a new album. Then, in 2004, I was seriously injured in a motorbike accident and recovery was very slow.|In 2017, after not seeing each other for years, we reunited to play at the O2. I feared it would be empty, but it sold out! It was a magical experience.|Proud Marc with his OBE after the ceremony at Buckingham Palace|(|Image:|Getty)|A couple of years ago I was appointed OBE \u2013 flabbergasting! I took my 81-year-old mum to Buckingham Palace \u2013 she loved it.|In my spare time I\u2019m studying to be a Druid; fancy dressing in robes and dancing around Stonehenge. I\u2019m quite a narcissist, so I look in the mirror and despair. Ageing is a war that gets harder to fight.|There will come a point when I just give in, but you have to keep being a star, who your fans want you to be, until the last moment. Then you should just retire and never be seen again.|I\u2019ll happily pose for selfies but they\u2019re not flattering. I get asked to sing Tainted Love a lot, so I joke that I only do it for money! I\u2019ll gladly sing Happy Birthday into someone\u2019s mobile phone.|Now, I\u2019ve released my 30th solo album and have been working with great producers. I feel like I\u2019ve become a national treasure \u2013 never what I ever expected.|Most Read|Don't Miss|Follow|Mirror|Facebook|Twitter|Comment|MORE ON|Marc Almond|Music|Celeb obsessed?
