          "|Willner assembled the album because he felt Bolan was an overlooked figure: he noted that he \u201cwas hardly ever talked about as a composer\u201d, the conversation more often turning to \u201chow David Bowie took his essence and Bolan was in his shadow\u201d. That is certainly true in the US, where Get It on was T Rex\u2019s solitary hit, but the degree of enthusiasm the artists involved have for Bolan\u2019s work is enough to startle even a diehard T Rex obsessive like me.|Kesha was born a decade after|Bolan\u2019s death in 1977 in a car crash|and first heard T Rex in the early 00s. \u201cI just remember thinking, whatever this music was, it was the soundtrack of my soul: it really helped me unleash things inside me. I feel like I was raised by T Rex, because I didn\u2019t have a dad, so male figures in my life were the ones I\u2019d read about or listen to.\u201d|\u2018I feel like I was raised by T Rex\u2019 ... Kesha.|Photograph: Dana Trippe|What continues to attract musicians to an artist whose imperial phase lasted barely two years? The music, obviously: the golden run of singles that begins with 1970\u2019s Ride a White Swan and ends with 1973\u2019s 20th Century Boy; the insouciant, sexually charged brilliance of the albums Electric Warrior and The Slider. The image: what the Edge calls \u201cthat transgressional thing of challenging stereotypes and being this ambiguous creature \u2026 that really did create a new kind of space\u201d. The sense that, while other artists ultimately sold more records or had longer careers, it is hard to think of anyone who has been better at actually|being a pop star|than Bolan, with his self-mythologising lyrics \u2013 \u201cI drive a Rolls-Royce / \u2019Cos it\u2019s good for my voice\u201d \u2013 his interviews filled with wild claims and outrageously entertaining lies, his looks, his charisma.|\u201cHe was the perfect pop star,\u201d says John. \u201cHis songs were great, his records rocked, he had attitude, he had performing skills, he looked fabulous, he dressed the part. At a time when I was still becoming|Elton John|, he was a great role model. I thought: \u2018This guy doesn\u2019t give a fuck, he\u2019s just being who he is and he\u2019s loving every single minute of it.\u2019 And that had a great effect on me.\u201d|\u2018Maybe he could be running a cult in Fiji\u2019 ... Devendra Banhart.|Photograph: Ernesto Notarantonio/Ipa/Rex/Shutterstock|For another of the album\u2019s contributors, the singer-songwriter|Devendra Banhart|, part of Bolan\u2019s appeal is \u201cthe idea of switching up your style without any real concern, because he was really going for it\u201d. By the time of his first minor flush of fame in the late 60s, the former Marc Feld had already been a teenage mod who appeared in Town magazine, boasting about how many ties he owned, and a Dylan-inspired folkie called Toby Tyler, before becoming Marc Bolan, the author of two Donovan-esque flop solo singles and the guitarist and second vocalist in the Who-esque troublemakers John\u2019s Children.|Then came Tyrannosaurus Rex, an acoustic duo featuring Bolan and the percussionist Steve Peregrin-Took, but with the former evidently calling all the shots. Perhaps noting that Bolan was less committed to flower power idealism than he was to becoming famous, some areas of London\u2019s hippie counterculture regarded him with a jaundiced eye (\u201cHe was a cocky little shit,\u201d complains one underground luminary in Jonathon Green\u2019s definitive oral history of the era, Days in the Life), but the music Tyrannosaurus Rex made was frequently extraordinary. For an acoustic duo with a penchant for whimsy, they seldom sounded laid back: their songs charge along chaotically, fuelled by riffs and an energy closer to early rock\u2019n\u2019roll than folk.|Watch Nick Cave sing T Rex\u2019s Cosmic Dancer for the new tribute album Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T Rex|\u201cI just thought: \u2018Where the fuck has this come from?\u2019\u201d remembers John. \u201cI suppose it was a little like the Incredible String Band, but they were folkies \u2013 Marc Bolan was something different. He was sitting there in a cloak covered in stars, writing songs that sounded like Chuck Berry, very simple songs.|What?|\u201d|Banhart says: \u201cThe first time I heard Tyrannosaurus Rex, I thought: \u2018I am home. I\u2019m just in love. These are the best lyrics, this is the most fun energy, this is what real punk is to me. The nakedness of it. Led Zeppelin can hide behind these bombastic, heavy, aggressive walls of sound in order to sing about Mordor, but Marc is just singing about this wild, fantastical, Tolkienish world with nothing but the exoticness of his character.|\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the rock\u2019n\u2019roll thing, songs about cars, celebrating the interior of his Mustang Ford: \u2018It\u2019s all put together with alligator leather.\u2019 It isn\u2019t really psychedelic, it\u2019s a very particular thing.\u201d|Team spirit ... with Mickey Finn, who joined Bolan\u2019s band in its Tyrannosaurus Rex guise, in 1971.|Photograph: Araldo di Crollalanza/Rex|Over four albums, and with the help of|the producer Tony Visconti|, Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s sound expanded, Bolan gradually cranking up his electric guitar. You can hear vague intimations of what was going to happen \u2013 on the 1969 single King of the Rumbling Spires and on A Beard of Stars, the first album Bolan recorded with the percussionist Mickey Finn replacing Peregrin-Took \u2013 but clearly no one expected Ride a White Swan, the first release under the snappier name T Rex: sharper, more streamlined, more poppy, every instrument drenched in the kind of slapback echo found on old rock\u2019n\u2019roll records. The lyrics still sounded hippyish, but if any record can claim to have announced the arrival of the 70s, it is Ride a White Swan. \u201cI heard John Peel play it and I thought: \u2018This is amazing,\u2019\u201d says John. \u201cIt sounded like something that had come down from a spaceship; it was so out-there.\u201d|Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us|The Edge|It eventually reached No 2. Bolan expanded T Rex\u2019s lineup, bringing in the drummer Bill Legend and the bassist Steve Currie, and overhauled his image at the behest of his manager\u2019s wife, Chelita Secunda \u2013 out with the hippy cloaks, in with girls\u2019 clothes, satin and makeup (\u201cHe wore makeup during the day,\u201d remembers John, \u201cwhich I\u2019d never seen a man do before \u2013 I thought that was so cool\u201d). He played on his looks, amped up the sexuality in his music \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m gonna SUCK you,\u201d he howled on Jeepster \u2013 and that was that for the next two years: four No 1 singles, three No 1 albums, a film directed by Ringo Starr, hysteria the press called T Rextasy. There was far more depth to his songs than he was given credit for at the time \u2013 as Banhart points out, between \u201cthe flashiness, the smart lines, the cool boasts\u201d, there was a curious darkness in his lyrics: \u201cAll schools are strange\u201d, \u201cI danced myself into the tomb\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I\u2019m like me\u201d. Perhaps people couldn\u2019t hear over the screaming.|\u2018An understanding that things could be magical\u2019 ... U2\u2019s the Edge.|Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty Images|\u201cIt felt like he actually cast a spell,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt every aspect of how he presented himself was just an outpouring of his understanding that things could be magical, things could be heightened. Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us.\u201d|And then it went wrong. His grip on the songwriting he had honed to a kind of minimalist perfection on 1972\u2019s Metal Guru \u2013 a single that sounds like one long chorus \u2013 faltered. Bolan was rattled by his failure to break the US. \u201cI think he was just too androgynous for a lot of folks here,\u201d suggests Joan Jett, another Angelheaded Hipster contributor, who says Bolan was her first teenage crush. \u201cRadio just went for the safer stuff. I know from being in the Runaways how everyone treated us, so I just know they would have had issues with a Marc Bolan type of guy.\u201d|Bolan with his partner Gloria Jones, a former Motown staff writer.|Photograph: Estate of Keith Morris/Redferns|He was|smart enough to call time on glam|with 1974\u2019s elegiac single Teenage Dream and sharp enough to spot that the next thing might be a kind of rock/soul hybrid some time before his longstanding frenemy David Bowie decamped to Philadelphia. But having had the right idea, he couldn\u2019t quite make it work.|Bowie\u2019s Young Americans|sounded like an effortless reinvention. For all the bona fides of his|new partner Gloria Jones|\u2013 a former staff writer at Motown \u2013 Bolan\u2019s brand of plastic soul often felt like hard going, overstuffed with ideas. The other members of T Rex left, one by one, leaving him to front a band of session musicians. Tony Visconti baled out after 1974\u2019s poorly received Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow, claiming Bolan would no longer listen to anyone but yes-men.|Occasionally, something sparked, as on 1975\u2019s brilliant Think Zinc, but the album it came from, Bolan\u2019s Zip Gun, failed to chart.|Still, a prevailing wind started blowing in his favour once more. He had a couple of strong hits, New York City and I Love to Boogie, curbed the excesses that had left him looking bloated and finally nailed the soul-inspired sound on his great 1976 album Futuristic Dragon. Moreover, the emerging punk scene was staffed by people who had grown up in front of Top of the Pops at the height of T Rextasy and taken notes: three chords, distorted guitars, killer singles, be outrageous. Under punk\u2019s scorched-earth policy, vast tranches of rock\u2019s past were dismissed: T Rex were not.|\u201cThere was incredible discipline in T Rex\u2019s work,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cElectric Warrior is full of what I would call rock\u2019n\u2019roll 45s, which is such a rare thing: using rock and blues and guitar, but not losing sight of making great, accessible songs that have hooks and ideas and groove. They were an amazing band from that point of view, and that\u2019s the thing that I think a lot of rock lost sight of, progressive rock and whatever \u2013 whatever it was, it was not sexy music. I think the T Rex discipline is what gave them the chance to survive.\u201d|The admiration was mutual. Most established artists mocked or dismissed punk, or simply looked on with detached bemusement. Bolan, however, jumped in feet first: it seemed to activate the wild enthusiasm that John remembers: \u201cHe was always encouraging, never belittling; being with him was like having a hundred B12 injections at once.\u201d|Happy family ... Bolan and the Ramones in London, 1976.|Photograph: Richard Young/Rex|Bolan was in the audience for the Ramones\u2019 first UK gig. He took the Damned on tour with him and peppered his kids\u2019 TV show, Marc, with appearances by punk bands. You could say the fact that he was now presenting a kids\u2019 TV show was evidence of how far his star had fallen, but Bolan was pretty magnificent on it,|mercilessly hamming it up for the cameras|. \u201cThis is a new group called Generation X. They have a lead singer called Billy Idol who\u2019s supposed to be as pretty as me,\u201d he murmurs, effetely sniffing a flower. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d|A week after recording that link,|Bolan was dead, aged 29|. The premature death of an artist inevitably conjures a lot of what-ifs. It is tempting to wonder what might have happened had Bolan lived to see the glitter-obsessed denizens of the Blitz club and the synth era; to hear the Smiths rewriting Metal Guru as Panic or Get It on recast as Oasis\u2019s Cigarettes and Alcohol; or to enjoy British glam finally gaining US commercial success by proxy thanks to heavy metal: Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Slash stole his image from Bolan\u2019s Slider-era top hat and curls look; Def Leppard\u2019s Joe Elliott claimed that Pour Some Sugar on Me was an attempt to mimic T Rex\u2019s lyrics.|And it is tempting to wonder what Bolan might have made of another pre-eminent musical genius who clearly listened to T Rex, which Prince made explicit when he released his 1991 Bolan homage, Cream. \u201cWhen I met Prince, I thought he was like Marc: ethereal, very androgynous,\u201d says John. \u201cIf you look at the two of them, they\u2019re very similar, the way they posed. I can imagine Prince singing Telegram Sam, I can imagine Marc singing Raspberry Beret.\u201d|Glitter and curls: Marc Bolan and the birth of glam rock style|Read more|The truth is that he would have probably taken it all as his due \u2013 whatever his flaws, being crippled by modesty wasn\u2019t among them \u2013 just as he would taken Angelheaded Hipster and the praise from younger artists. \u201cHis attitude has really informed the way I look at my life,\u201d says|Kesha|. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t know what to do, like how to feel or how to behave, I think of people like Marc Bolan and all of a sudden it becomes more fun.\u201d|\u201cWhat would he be doing if he were alive today?\u201d muses Banhart. \u201cHe could be what Elon Musk is.

We open with The Wizard, the solo debut single that began Bolan\u2019s myth-building \u2013 he claimed he had studied sorcery under the titular sorcerer in France; his manager,|Simon Napier-Bell|, unsportingly suggested that Bolan had just met a man who did conjuring tricks in a Paris nightclub. Then there are the fantastic, wild, freakbeat singles Bolan wrote for John\u2019s Children that underlined the impossibility of him ever functioning merely as a band\u2019s backing singer: his voice looms out of the mix, overpowering everything else, a bizarre, quavering bleat he had apparently designed to draw as much attention to himself as possible.|Listen to Alex Petridis\u2019s Marc Bolan playlist|Spotify|The playlist picks its way along Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s path from hippy oddity to proto-glam.

          "|Nineteen forty-seven also marked the birth of the semiconductor revolution. Bell Laboratory scientists William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain announced the invention of the Bipolar Junction Transistor. The discovery caused little commotion at the time, but soon everyone would be carrying their own personal transistor radios. Three decades later, semiconductor manufacturers around the world would be spewing out millions of tiny microprocessors, each carrying well over a million transistors and capable of executing over one-hundred-million instructions per second.|In sports, Jackie Robinson became the first black man to sign a contract \nwith a major baseball club and New York beat Brooklyn to win the 1947 \nWorld Series.|Britain had just come through its most severe winter since 1894. But the cold of winter was quickly forgotten as the country prepared itself for a royal wedding between the heir to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, and Philip Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh.|And in the East London suburb of Hackney, a working-class Jewish couple, Simeon and Phyllis Feld, were expecting a child. Phyllis worked days at a fruit stand in Soho while Simeon worked at various odd jobs including cosmetic salesman and truck driver. On September 30th, 1947, the couple gave birth at Hackney General Hospital to a son and they named him Mark.|As far as Mark was concerned, he was born a star. \"When I was younger\", he recalled, \"I certainly thought I was a superior kind of being. And I didn't feel related to other human beings.\" Mark's parents remember him as a very strong willed boy who would kick anyone he didn't like. He had his share of fights during his school years and was a member of a local gang known as the Sharks. On one occasion, Mark claimed to have been knifed during a fight with a rival gang.|Mark had a strong imagination and would often make believe that he was Audie Murphy, Mighty Joe Young, or the Phantom of the Opera. He was also an avid movie fan. He most enjoyed science fiction and horror films and could name every title, actor, producer, and director.|Mark gained an appreciation for music at an early age spending hours listening to his parent's record collection. His favorite was a song about an American frontiersman from Tennessee, a place far away and much different than the London Mark grew up in. The song was \"The Ballad of Davey Crockett\" by an American songwriter named Bill Hayes. Mark's father, eager to encourage his son's interest in music, went out shopping one day to buy another record by his son's favorite musician, but he made an innocent mistake that would change the course of Mark's life forever. Instead of buying another record by Bill Hayes, Simeon confused the name with another American. The artist was Bill Haley and the song was \"Rock Around The Clock\". At age eight, Mark Feld had been handed his calling.|The Young Mark Feld|It didn't take long for Mark to act on his love for music. He first built himself a makeshift guitar which he used to learn the basics. He then talked his indulgent parents into buying him a drum kit. Later, when he was nine they bought him a guitar for 16 pounds which was nearly a month of Simeon's salary.|His mother would later recall how Mark would go to see someone like Cliff Richard in concert and come home saying \"that's how I'll be one day.\" Among his earliest compatriots were Keith Reid, future lyricist for Procul Harum, Cat Stevens, and a young man whose life would often be intertwined with his own, David Bowie.|Mark began to build a record collection with money he made doing odd jobs which included serving espresso behind the counter at the legendary 2 I's on Old Compton Street. The 2 I's served as a launching pad for many famous British acts including a young man named Harry Webb who would later change his name to Cliff Richard. Mark himself auditioned there, supposedly on the same day as did Harry Webb, but was turned down.|At age 12 Mark joined a 3 piece band called Susie and The Hula Hoops as a tea-chest bass player. The band's lead vocalist was named Helen Shapiro. Helen would eventually leave the band and within months record a string of pop-hit singles including two number 1 hits in Britain. Although Mark would deny that it had any impact on him, many believed that her success spurred him on to pursue his own path to stardom. He dropped out of school, having already been expelled, and went in search of an opportunity in acting.|During this time Mark befriended the girls from a British TV show called \"Oh Boy\". The girls would take Mark to all of their performances at the Hackney Empire. It was there that Mark had one of his first face-to-face meetings with a contemporary rock star.|Rock and Roll had been born in the USA and was being exported to\nEurope by a handful of early American rock stars who's popularity\noverseas nearly dwarfed their popularity back home in the States. One\nof these stars was Eddie Cochran and it was he who happened to be at the Hackney Empire on this night for his first Brittish tour.|Eddie Cochran|As the story goes, following Eddie Cochran's performance at the Hackney Empire, Cochran handed his guitar to the then 13 year old starry eyed Mark Feld who proceeded to carry the guitar to Cochran's waiting limousine. It was a moment that Mark was always proud to relate and one that would often be singled out as an important event in Mark's life, as if that event - the act of having touched Eddie Cochran's guitar, had some greater, almost mystical, significance.|This story, unfortunately, has a tragic and perhaps eerily ironic ending. At the end of Cochran's tour of England, the taxi carrying Cochran, his girlfriend Sharon Sheely, and fellow American Rock Star Gene Vincent, blew a tire while on its way to the London Airport. The car swerved off the road and slammed into a lamp post. Several hours later, on April 17th, 1960, Eddie Cochran joined his good friend Buddy Holly on the list of early rockers who gained instant immortality through a tragic death.|At age 13 Mark spotted a man walking down the street in front of his house wearing clothes which would become typical of the Mod movement in Britain. The sight so impressed Mark that he began spending all of his money on similar clothes. Later, commenting on this period of his life, Mark would say that he had an obsession with clothes, owning forty suits and often changing them 4 or 5 times a day. \"I used to go home and literally pray to become a Mod,\" he would remember.|Bumping into Angus McGill one day, a writer for the Evening Standard, Mark bragged about all of the clothes he owned. McGill followed Mark home to see his collection of clothes. Impressed with what he saw, McGill recruited Mark for a feature article about the Mod scene in Town magazine, a forerunner of modern men's magazines such as GQ. The article was entitled 'Faces Without Shadows' and was written by a fellow named Peter Barnsley. It included some of the earliest photographs of Mark to ever appear in print. They were taken by Don McCullin - Later to become a famous war photographer.|Beneath one of the pictures Barnsley included the following paragraph which included a rather ominous prediction:|Mark As Model|\"Feld is fifteen years old, and still at school. His family has just moved from Stamford Hill to a pre-fab out in Wimbledon. Of this he does not approve. The queues of Teds outside the cinemas in Wimbledon look just like a contest for the worst haircut, he says. At least the boys of Stamford hill dress sharply, and who would want a new, clean house if it is in unsympathetic surroundings? Nonetheless cleanliness is of vital importance to him. Shining with soap and health, he is apparently tireless and often goes for days on end without any sleep; there is never a trace of fatigue or boredom in his face.\n\"What is the point of all this energy and all the soap and water? Where is the goal towards which he is obviously running as fast as his impeccably shod feet can carry him? It is nowhere. He is running to stay in the same place and he knows by the time he has reached his mid-twenties the exhausting race will be over and he will have lost.\"|Following these events Mark was introduced to a modeling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\". As such he was used as a model for their suits in their catalogues as well as a model for cardboard cutouts to be displayed in their shop windows. Whether because they were unimpressed or because they wanted to keep their catalogue fresh with new faces is uncertain, but he was never used again.|Mark then shifted his focus back towards music and, at age 17, made another attempt to kick-start a career in the business. Sporting a denim cap and playing an acoustic guitar, he decided to try his hand at the British folk circuit. The sound resembled a Dylan/Donovan mix and, indeed, his songs consisted of some Dylan covers and a few other folksy tunes. To complete the new look and sound, Mark even came up with a new name for himself. Thus it was that the short music career of Toby Tyler began.|Mark as Toby Tyler|It didn't take long until Toby met up with an actor named Allan Warren\nwho offered to become his manager. Allan helped arrange recording time\nfor Toby and they proceeded to record several tunes including Dylan's\n\"Blowin' in the wind\". A version of Betty Everett's \"You're No Good\"\nwas submitted to EMI for a test screening but they turned Toby\ndown. Deciding that the future for Toby Tyler looked bleak, Warren and\nToby parted company after which Toby Tyler once again became simply\nMark Feld. (There was one small change however, but it's not clear to\nme when exactly it occurred. And that is that somewhere around this\ntime period, Mark chose to drop the \"k\" from his name and replace it with a\n\"c\". Therefore, many poems and diaries from this period were signed as\nMarc Feld rather than as Mark Feld.)|The tapes produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished from thought and mind for over twenty-five years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly eight-thousand dollars. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available the earliest of Marc's known recordings.|With yet another attempt to get into the music business at a dead end, Marc found himself hanging around the National Theatre looking for work. He was able to land several character parts in some TV shows including a delinquent on the Sam Kydd TV series and a show called 'Orlando'. But TV acting bored Marc so he decided to take an extended trip to France.|The accounts of what happened in France differ and not even Marc ever seemed to tell the same story twice. He was known to occasionally stretch the truth or fabricate pieces of it and seemed to often forget which parts were real and which were fantasies. He once admitted to an interviewer that he felt that his credibility as a poet allowed him to stretch the truth or make things up.|In any case, according to Marc's accounts he met a magician who lived\nin a 40 room mansion with libraries of books on mythology and black\nmagic. Marc claimed to have witnessed levitations, seances, and\ncrucifixions of live cats. He even claimed to have at one point\nwitnessed a ceremony at which the attendees resorted to consumption of\nhuman flesh. All of this, recall, was from Marc's own\naccounts. According to one of Marc's early producers, Simon\nNapier-Bell, however, Marc had merely met a guy who did magic tricks\nand spent a weekend with him.|Whatever the real truth, the experience had a profound effect on Marc. He left France with a much more highly developed imagination and a near obsession with Greek mythology, British romantic poetry, and the Tolkien books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of The Rings\". The Tolkien books had reached nearly Biblical status with the sixties generation of hippies and they would have a tremendous influence on Marc's early song writing; manifesting themselves in the form of enchanted poems and lyrics.|Marc returned to Britain more determined than ever to become a star. He locked himself away for months writing songs in a manic frenzy of inspiration. His future wife would later describe his writing style in terms of \"a force flowing out of him\". He himself contributed it to the work of his Guardian Angel whom, he was sure, really did all of the writing. During this period of time, Marc would churn out a reservoir of songs which he would still be tapping into five albums later. Among them was a song which he entitled \"The wizard\" in honor of his wizardly friend in France. With the help of producer Jim Economedies, he recorded the song and landed a record contract with Decca.|When Marc received the initial samples of \"The Wizard\" from Decca he\nreceived a mild shock. His name had been changed again; but this time\nwithout his approval. Decca had decided that the name Marc Feld would\nNOT do and had changed his last name to \"Bowland\". The name change\ndidn't bother Marc as much as did the fact that he had not been\nconsulted about the matter. As would become typical of other events in\nhis future, Marc refused to allow Decca to have it their way without\nhis stamp of approval. After negotiations, he convinced them to drop\nthe W and the D from Bowland to shorten the name to BOLAN. Thus, Marc\nFeld became Marc Bolan and in November of 1965 \"The Wizard\" was\nreleased and the voice and music of Marc Bolan was broadcast for the\nfirst time over British airwaves.|Mark Feld as Marc Bolan|Decca's press release on the Wizard single was a masterpiece of sixties hype. It read:|\"Marc Bolan was born in September 1947. After 15 years had passed he traveled to Paris and met a black magician called The Wizard, He lived for 18 months in The Wizard's chateau with Achimedies, an owl, and the biggest, whitest Siamese cat you ever saw. He then felt the need to spend some time alone so he made his way to woods, near Rome. For two weeks he strove to find himself and then he returned to London where he began to write. His writings mirror his experiences with mentionings of the magician's pact with the great god Pan. In London, walking down Kings Road, Chelsea in the dead of night, he chanced to meet a girl named Lo-og who gave him a magic cat. This cat, named after the girl, is now his constant companion and is a source of inspiration to him. Now The Wizard's tale is set down for all to hear on Marc's first recording for Decca.\"|A small poem accompanied two photographs of Bolan. It read:|\"Standing alone in the wood, with the golden palace bleeding scarlet tears into the sunset, I thought of all the treasures in the magic palace. And all the emptiness in my stomach and I smiled secretly, Rememberin' the wizard's words.\"|A critic for Disc Magazine reviewed the Wizard as follows:|\"On the strength of this strange young man's looks and weird background I suspect we'll hear more of this odd record about meeting a Wizard in the woods who knew all. I prefer the other side, 'Beyond the Risin' Sun' which has more tune. Jim Economedies, ace producer, does lovely things on this. I'm a bit put off by the way this boy sings with Dylan phrasing but that's all.\"|A record contract doesn't mean instant success and Marc found himself hustling for interviews and write-ups. One of his first interviews as Marc Bolan was with Angus McGill, the same writer who had interviewed Marc years earlier about the Mod trend. According to Angus he simply did not recognize the new Marc. \"I had remembered him as a rather plain little chap\", he said, \"and suddenly there was the most glamorous young man you'd ever seen, all curls and exotic clothes. He played the record, which I thought was appalling and showed me some poetry which struck me as unmitigated rubbish. I never thought he'd make it. But then I once predicted that TV would never catch on either.\"|Keith Altham, Marc's future publicist who at this point in time was just an acquaintance, remembers Marc frequenting a bar called the Brewmaster. He would come in carrying his record and say \"Gotta listen to this fellas, I'm going to be the greatest thing since Elvis Presley.\" \"Nice little bloke Marc!\", they all thought, \"Sit down and have a Coca Cola.\" No one really expected him to get too far.|Marc performed \"The Wizard\" on the TV show \"Ready, Steady, Go\". Unfortunately, the band missed out on the intro, played too fast, and in the wrong key. To make matters worse the show encountered technical problems and the signal went dead for most of Marc's debut. It was a disaster.|In June of 66 Decca released a follow up single called \"The Third Degree\" backed by what Marc called an unfinished demo titled \"San Francisco Poet\". It flopped. This single was to have been followed up by a song called \"Jasper C. Debussy\" but by then Marc's contract with Decca had expired and Marc had moved on to Columbia and producer Simon Napier-Bell.|Following his lack of success with Decca, Marc called producer Simon Napier-Bell and told him \"I'm a singer and I'm going to be the biggest rock star ever, so I need a good manager to make all the arrangements.\" Simon told him to send him his demo tapes but Marc insisted that he was close by and could just drop them in. Ten minutes later he arrived at Simon's office with his guitar around his neck and announced that he had no demo tapes after all but would be happy to sing a few tunes for him. He sat in a chair cross-legged, accentuating his short stature, and played all the songs on acoustic guitar - enough, according to Simon, to fill nearly four albums. By the end of the set, Simon was on the phone booking some time in a local recording studio.|Simon recalled that Marc was ridiculously egotistical at the time, to the point where it was easy to get furious with him. He actually thought that all he needed to do was to make a few posters of himself and things would just sort of happen. Simon disagreed and convinced Mark to add some strings to one of the songs, called \"hippy gumbo\", and approach some record companies with it.|Unfortunately, none of the record companies liked the tune. When Simon told Marc the news, he was completely shattered - not even expecting to be turned down. Eventually however, Simon was able to convince Columbia records to take Marc on and the single was released in June of '67. This single was another flop and was greeted with bad reviews including one that called the single, quote, \"a crazed mixture of an incredibly bad negro blues singer and Larry the Lamb.\"|Marc made a second appearance on \"Ready, Steady, Go\" to promote 'Hippy Gumbo'. This appearance went much better than his first but it was overshadowed by the first British TV appearance of Jimi Hendrix. Marc later boasted that Hendrix told him how much he liked his voice but that he would never make it. In some respects this prediction was true in as much as by mid 1967 the short solo career of Marc Bolan had failed to take root.|Simon Napier-Bell happened to be producing two other groups at this point in time. One was The Yardbirds, which included future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Watching the Yardbirds work was one of the things Marc would later recall as one of the highlights of this period. The other band was a group called John's Children who were signed to the Who's label, Track.|John's Children had previously been known as the Silence which had developed from a number of even earlier bands such as the Clockwork Onions and The Few. The name John's Children came about because bass player John Hewlett was the leader of the band. The other band members were lead singer Andy Ellison, guitarist Geoff McClelland, and drummer Chris Townsen who occasionally deputized for the Who's Keith Moon. The band had already caused quite a stir in England after having done some nude publicity shots and performing some relatively wild stage acts. Today they are remembered as one of the first psychedelic bands of this era.|John's children had already released two singles. One was called \"The Love I Thought I'd Found\" which was released in America retitled as \"Smashed!! Blocked!!\". The second single was called \"Not The Sort Of Girl You Take To Bed\" which flopped. Following these two singles guitarist Geoff McClelland was kicked out of the band, having failed to live up to the expectations of his fellow band members or the owner of the Track record label, Kit Lambert, who was also the Who's manager at the time.|In addition to the Who, Lambert had signed Jimi Hendrix and John's Children to his record label but insisted that Marc Bolan be included in the deal as John's Children's guitarist. The deal was acceptable to Simon-Napier Bell who, having failed to make Marc Bolan a solo success, saw a union between John's Children and Marc as a move that would potentially benefit both parties. John's children would have a better guitarist as well as one that could write music and Marc could broaden his exposure by joining up with a band that had already established a following. Marc found the deal acceptable if for no other reason than he would be recording on the same record label as Jimi Hendrix whom he had immense respect for.|Bolan Era John's Children|The merger was made and the new line up of John's Children headed for the recording studio to put down some new tracks. After one week they emerged with several demos and releasable songs. The first to be released was a Bolan compilation called Desdemona. Andy Ellison performed the lead vocals on the song but Bolan's unique voice was unmistakably present on the background vocals. The single was released in May of '67 and initially appeared to be headed for the top of the charts. Unfortunately, The BBC dealt the song a fatal blow by banning the song because it considered the line \"lift up your skirt and fly\" to be offensive. Despite this the song was popular and to this day is considered to be one of the finest British releases of 1967.|Onstage, John's children were as controversial as their music. Andy Ellison was prone to getting excessively wild, jumping around the stage, leaping into the crowd and occasionally attacking other members of the band. Marc would swing between moods sometimes simply sitting cross-legged on the stage and other times running around the stage in circles.|In their private lives, however, Marc was clearly apart from the others. Andy Ellison would later recall that the rest of the band was into drugs and dropping acid while Marc would only occasionally sip a little wine and spent most of his time simply writing songs. This, among other reasons, was why the merger of Bolan with John's children was to be a relatively short-lived union.|Marc also grew increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that John, not he, was choosing the musical direction of the band. Their second single with Marc was to have been \"Midsummer Nights Scene\" with \"Sarah Crazy Child\" on the flip side - both Bolan compositions. But, for reasons that are still unclear, the single was shelved at the last minute even though it had already been pressed. In its place was released a Hewlett/Townsen number called \"Come And Play With Me In The Garden\".|Then, perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back, a concert in Ludswigshaven, Germany while touring Europe with the Who, nearly ended in disaster. Near the end of their set the band jumped into a song entitled \"You're a Nothing\" which ended with a repeated German chant. Andy Ellison grew quite a bit more wild than usual and jumped off the stage with a large sack of feathers that he had pulled from hotel pillows. While he went about the business of tossing feathers at the crowd, Marc began beating at his amps with chains, and the rest of the band began chanting the German slogan. Eventually, a riot broke out. Fans began to rush the stage and the band just narrowly made an escape to the safety of their limousines. They drove off just as the police began moving in armored cars to quell the riot. The Who had to cancel their act that night and the German government confiscated a good deal of John's Children's equipment.|Marc left the band soon after - less than 6 months after joining it.|But he left John's Children with a mission - to establish his own rock band under his own complete control. Still wielding the electric guitars and amps he had used with John's children, Marc put ads in the International Times looking for other musicians. Not patient enough to wait, he also booked a gig at the Electric Garden in London's Covent Garden, a club that would later change its name to \"Middle Earth\" after the mythical land in the Tolkien trilogies.|An 18 year old drummer named Steve Turner responded to the add. Marc hired him but convinced him to change his name to Steve Peregrine Took after the youngest of the four hobbits in the Lord of The Rings trilogy. The name change was fine for Steve apparently as long as Marc didn't mind being referred to as Nalob Cram - Marc Bolan spelled backwards.|Steve Peregrine Took|In addition to bringing a full drumkit to the band, Steve Took could also acceptably integrate several other strange instruments into the music such as kazoos and pixiephones. He could also handle backing vocals quite well being able to immediately find a harmony for nearly anything Marc sang. According to Marc's soon to be producer Tony Visconti, Steve was perhaps the only person who was ever able to really get inside Marc's head and travel the distance into the Middle Earth landscape where most of his musical themes took place.|In addition to Steve, Marc recruited a 28 year old bearded guitarist named Ben who, according to Steve, kept turning green with stomach ulcers and a bass guitarist who was also a lot older than Marc and Steve and smoked a pipe which clearly labeled him as an undesirable - or at least so thought Steve. There was one other member of the band, but little is documented or remembered about him. In fact, the identities of all three of these original band members remains a mystery today.|Marc needed a name for this new band. Naturally he wanted a name that reflected his belief in mythology but knew that most people didn't adhere to such beliefs. But Marc reasoned that modern science had firmly proven the existence of the dinosaurs; creatures that, far more than anything else known to man, encroached on the boundaries of mythology. And if such creatures had existed millions of years ago, then who could argue against the possibility that even long before they existed there may have been creatures more like fire breathing dragons and other mythological creatures. Following this reasoning, Marc decided to name his band after a dinosaur. But not just any dinosaur would do. It had to be the biggest and baddest of them all - the king of the dinosaurs; the Tyrannosaurus Rex.|With a new band and a new name, Marc headed for the Covent Garden. Time didn't allow for such trivialities as rehearsing so the band practiced together only once before the show. The result was disastrous. The band members were simply incompatible and the total lack of rehearsal understandably didn't help. The band was promptly booed off the stage and disbanded almost immediately afterwards. To make matters worse, Track records, who owned most of what remained of John's Children's equipment following the German fiasco, repossessed Marc's electric guitar and amps. Then, to scrape up enough cash to obtain the bare necessities of life, Steve had to sell his drumkit and replaced it with a simple pair of bongos.|Thus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, which Marc had started with the best of\nintentions, had disintegrated into a 2 piece band owning only a set of\nbongos and an acoustic guitar. They may well have vanished from the\nmusic histories altogether had it not been for the support of a very\nearly ally and big fan - radio disk jockey|John Peel|.|Tyrannosaurus Rex|John had operated an illegal offshore radio station which was eventually shut down by the BBC. But being illegal allowed Peel to play lots of music NOT allowed or sanctioned by the BBC including underground bands like Tyrannosaurus Rex. After the offshore radio was shut down, Peel was hired by the Middle Earth club and immediately recruited the fledgling Tyrannosaurus Rex as a house band. Later, after landing a job at Radio One, John would often invite Tyrannosaurus Rex to play live on his show. Some of these recordings along with those from many other bands are currently available on a series of albums and CDs known as the Peel sessions. John also made sure that whenever he was asked to MC at clubs throughout England, Tyrannosaurus Rex was brought along as his warm-up band. Eventually, this exposure began to build a following for the band and they were soon being asked to play at various colleges and open air festivals around England. They even appeared at the first free Hyde Park festival in 1968.|Thus, with John Peel's help, Marc's Tyrannosaurus Rex survived the Winter of 1968.

Photo credit: BBC|T-Rex fans will be delighted with the news that the British glam rockers will \u201cofficially\u201d be acknowledged as rock and roll legends being nominated along with Whitney Houston and Biggie Smalls aka Notorious B.I.G into the 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The significance in this historical moment musically speaking is how the main operator behind the band, Marc Bolan took the definition of what rock and roll is all about to another dimension with his musical range that remains to be impressive by today\u2019s standards.|According to\u00a0Gloria Jones, Bolan\u2019s then girlfriend, bandmate and mother of their son, Rolan Feld Bolan said to|Billboard|,|\u201cHe was a very humble spirit, but he understood who he was. He understood his worth.\u201d Nevertheless, Jones adds, the glam rock pioneer, \u201cwould have been very, very honored, and I\u2019m sure he would have been brought to tears. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very happy, and he\u2019s very honored.\u201d|Why Marc Bolan Remains To Be A Glam Rebelling Rock Icon \u2013 A Flamboyant Identity That Thwarts The Restraints of Society Standards|Marc Bolan was way ahead of his time in his short career as one of the top charting artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
          "|Much has been made of exactly how the glitter ended up on Bolan\u2019s cheeks. In a 1974 BBC interview, Bolan said: \u201cThere was some of my wife\u2019s glitter and I just spit on me fingers and stuck it under me eyes. I thought it looked cute \u2026\u201d|In one Bolan biography, his then wife, June Child, claimed the idea was hers. Numerous sources, however, cite Chelita Secunda, the wife of Bolan\u2019s manager at the time, as the woman behind the glitter. \u201cChelita was a muse to Marc Bolan,\u201d remarked artist Duggie Fields in Michael Bracewell\u2019s book Roxy: The Band That Invented an Era. \u201cIndeed, being the instigator of Marc\u2019s addiction to glitter and women\u2019s clothes, she can be held responsible for much of the look now referred to as glam rock.\u201d In Paul Trynka\u2019s biography, David Bowie: Starman, the DJ Jeff Dexter is quoted as saying that Chelita gave Bolan some glitter at her house, in the presence of Bowie and Elton John. \u201cShe wore glitter herself, and one day she put glitter on Marc. David was there and said, \u2018I want some\u2019, and [Elton] had some too. So the birth of glam rock was definitely at Chelita\u2019s.\u201d|In any case, rock and popular culture would never be the same. Far from being a mere twopenny prince in Persian gloves, as he described himself in Hot Love, Bolan had become the progenitor \u2013 and king \u2013 of glam. \u201cOh man, I need TV when I\u2019ve got T. Rex!\u201d Bowie would later exclaim in his song|All the Young Dudes|.|For the next couple years or so, \u201cT. Rextasy\u201d was all the rage in Britain. In his sparkly lam\u00e9 and plush, leopard-print blazers, feather boas, top hats and mary-jane shoes \u2013 not to mention generous helpings of mascara, eyeshadow and powder \u2013 Bolan belted out hit after catchy hit, looking exquisite.|Satin and tat: Bolan in London in the mid 70s.|Photograph: MARKA/Alamy|\u201cSatin suits and boas and the Anello and Davide mary janes were|his|look\u201d, says designer Anna Sui, who described Bolan as a \u201cperennial\u201d style inspiration. Biba\u2019s founder, Barbara Hulanicki, remembers a sequinned rainbow blazer of hers that Bolan wore in a number of photographs: \u201cHe was small. I have a feeling it came off the girls\u2019 floor. Oh, he looked so amazing in that jacket.\u201d|He also looked conspicuously androgynous for the era, a quality that the writer Simon Reynolds says was one of the things that defined Bolan. Before Bowie\u2019s sexually ambiguous incarnation as Ziggy Stardust or Brian Eno\u2019s colourful gender-bending in Roxy Music, Bolan had popularised an image and attitude untypical of British male rockers. \u201cI think [my use of glitter] caused a change \u2026 especially with cosmetics,\u201d Bolan said in the BBC interview \u201cGuys could go out on stage \u2026 being not|effeminate|, but not necessarily having to have Brut aftershave on \u2013 you know, super-masculine. You could use makeup and you could use [other such] things to brighten the act.\u201d|T. Rextasy was all too brief, as was Bolan\u2019s life, which ended in 1977, when girlfriend Gloria Jones crashed into a tree exactly two weeks before his 30th birthday. Like his music, the style he pioneered continues to influence. Alongside Gucci and Saint Laurent, labels such as Hedi Slimane\u2019s Celine and Halpern have at times drawn inspiration from Bolan\u2019s preference for chunky platforms, feather boas and snakeskin prints.

Then he returned to London but called me every day.|\"One day he told me his phone bill was so huge that I might as well fly over to him.|\"That's when it became different. He met me at the airport.

[She died in 1994.]|\"My mother went from a millionaire lifestyle to virtual poverty, and I often went without.|\"But even if we had money, it could never have made up for Dad not being there.|\"I don't remember being upset, but Mum tells me I often cried for him.\"|Learning that Gloria and Rolan were almost destitute, David Bowie came to the rescue.|Quietly, Bowie arranged to pay for Rolan's education in LA and settled other expenses as he was growing up.

I've had enough hassle over the estate as it is.\"|He is understandably relieved that the legal wrangles have been ironed out and that Marc's legacy is now coming through.|There is no suggestion of course that the trustees of Marc's affairs - Wizard (Bahamas) - have acted with anything less than strict regard for the legal rules.|It is only thanks to the determined efforts of Marc's record producer, Tony Visconti, that the way has finally been cleared.|He explains: \"Gloria and Marc never married, there was still a legal wife - June - in the background and Rolan suffered from archaic laws which don't allow an illegitimate child to inherit as of right.|\"The Estate of Marc Bolan stopped Rolan getting any regular payments. They were also holding up my own royalties as producer.|\"I successfully sued and it opened the gates for Rolan, because I got through. The Bolan fortune was quite a huge sum.\"|After a lengthy battle, the Trust has now arranged that Gloria and Rolan, who lives with his stepbrother, Walter Therman, can have a house from the investments in LA and that he will be given a \"controlled\" yearly allowance from the trust fund.|Marc's funeral was a hugely emotional affair, with thousands of fans sobbing as his coffin - topped by a huge floral white swan - was carried into the crematorium at Golders Green.|The tree on Barnes Common where the car crashed is a shrine permanently decked with flowers.|To commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, and his 60th birthday, there are TV documentaries, a double CD package called T.Rex - Greatest Hits and an exhibition of Bolan photos at London's Redfern Gallery.|On September 30, which would have been Marc's 60th birthday, there is to be a gala cabaret night, Bolan's Birthday Boogie, at London's Cafe de Paris which will feature a soundscape of his hits and evocative songs.|The evening will include the world premiere of A Fantasia Bolanesque, starring guest artists, including Boy George.|Rolan and Gloria Jones, and Marc's brother Harry Feld - a taxi driver - have been invited as guests of honour.|Gloria now helps run a children's orphanage in one of the poorest areas of Sierra Leone, West Africa, where she is also building the Marc Bolan School Of Music.|\"I want this time to be a celebration,\" she insists.|\"It is sad he is not here to see for himself how his music has lived on, but he was a happy person so everyone should be happy for him.|\"It is ironic that he is probably even bigger now than he was in his heyday.\"|She says she still finds it difficult to talk about the car crash.|\"I didn't come out of shock for 14 years. Marc was my soul-mate and we believed we had a great future together, which makes his death all the harder to bear.|\"There was the rock 'n' roll side to Marc, but really he was a quiet, humble boy.|\"I never saw the addictive side of him. Once Rolan was born he became a hands-on dad, and was very proud of him.\"|Says Rolan now: \"I've never tried to be like my father. Lately, I have been creating my own identity and impressing on people that they can be a fan of my father and still enjoy my music.|\"So I think any pressure I felt being 'son of Marc Bolan' has kind of gone away.\"|But after all the grief he has felt, he doesn't complain.|\"There are many times when I feel him around. Once I dreamed I was backstage at one of his shows and we talked as if we were really good friends but he didn't know I was his son.|\"Then I was in the audience and he pointed at me and he knew me. I woke up really happy.|\"Now, I go into a recording studio and I instinctively feel his spirit encouraging me, advising me.|\"If there is a problem in my life, I wonder what Dad would have done and I feel the answer coming into my head.|\"It's not as good as having him around in the flesh, but it is the next best thing.\"|Register for free to continue reading|Sign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events.|ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT?|LOG IN|Email|Please enter a valid email|Please enter a valid email|First name|Please enter a valid email|Please|Last name|2005|2004|2003|2002|2001|2000|1999|1998|1997|1996|1995|1994|1993|1992|1991|1990|1989|1988|1987|1986|1985|1984|1983|1982|1981|1980|1979|1978|1977|1976|1975|1974|1973|1972|1971|1970|1969|1968|1967|1966|1965|1964|1963|1962|1961|1960|1959|1958|1957|1956|1955|1954|1953|1952|1951|1950|1949|1948|1947|1946|1945|1944|1943|1942|1941|1940|1939|1938|1937|1936|1935|1934|1933|1932|1931|1930|1929|1928|1927|1926|1925|1924|1923|1922|1921|1920|1919|1918|1917|1916|1915|Year of birth|You must be at least 18 years old to create an account|Enter your password|Must be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number|I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.

          "|Speaking to The Independent on Sunday this weekend, Ms Aram described how she was driving just seconds behind Bolan on the ill-fated night: \"As I came over the bridge with Richard [Jones] beside me, I can still in my mind see, so clearly, a purple car which looked like a little beetle. It was upright and it was smoking and there was a tiny glimmer of light from the moon, the night was so still.\"|The \"little beetle\" was the Mini driven by Gloria Jones. Ms Aram said she didn't immediately stop at the car but drove a few metres past it.|\"I said 'we've got to get them out, this car might blow up'. I took my mother's rug from the back of my car and put it on the ground. Some of the fans are comforted by the fact he was laid on a nice lady's rug. I don't think Richard thought Marc was dead, but I knew he was. Gloria was groaning and almost conscious. But Richard cried and said 'please don't leave me'.\" In an eerie parallel with Bolan's death, Ms Aram said she crashed into a tree on the way to give evidence at Bolan's inquest a month later.|At the height of his fame in the early to mid-1970s, Bolan \u2013 born Mark Feld \u2013 outsold Jimi Hendrix and The Who with his band T Rex. But his good looks, catchy songs, air of mystique and untimely death at the age of 29 meant interest in the star has never waned.|Fee Warner, founder of the T Rex Action Group, bought the land where the sycamore tree stands to stop it from being felled. She and volunteers preserve the shrine dedicated to Bolan. Ms Warner, 53, said: \"A lot of people don't realise there was a fence between the tree and the road, because the fence was removed. When we came to build some steps, we found that when they had taken the fences away, they had taken away the ones that were undamaged, but the damaged ones had become buried on the site. That explains something which I have never been able to understand: why the damage to the tree is far higher than anything a Mini could have done.\"|Join our commenting forum|Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies|Comments|1|/|1|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|On the 35th anniversary of the glam rock star's death in a car accident, an eyewitness reveals what happened|\u2715|Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article|Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Rex Memorial|By|Eric Grundhauser|Photo: Chris/Creative Commons|Atlas Obscura on|Slate|is a blog about the world\u2019s hidden wonders. Like us on|Facebook|and|Tumblr|, or follow us on|Twitter|.|Father of the glam-rock trend during the 1970s along with his band\u00a0T. Rex, Marc Bolan was tragically killed, like so many rock stars, far too young, in a car accident in London in 1977.|Despite his influence on the pop cultural landscape of the 1970s,|the site of Bolan's death|was never officially recognized with a memorial. However, thanks to the musician's devoted fans, a shrine has been erected that continues to grow to this day.|Advertisement|The tribute to the musician began when lovers of Bolan's music began making pilgrimages to the site where the car in which he was a passenger collided with a tree. Visitors began hanging notes and trinkets from the sycamore tree the car had hit, which eventually spread to a posting board next to it. After years of devotional offerings being placed on the \"Bolan Tree,\" the branches started to give under the weight of the love hanging from its limbs, and the tree began to die.|Since the site was never officially recognized or cared for, no one knew what to do to save the tree, until a group of ultra-devoted fans formed the awesomely named \"T. Rex Action Group.\" TAG, as it came to be known, began caring for the spot and was eventually given ownership of the land in perpetuity. The group continues to look after and improve the site to this day.|Today a stone plaque has been added in addition to a bronze bust of the flamboyant performer. Bolan's musical influence continues to live, and new fans are born every day, assuring that the site of his death will continue to accumulate devotionals for another four decades.",

          "|]|Plaque marking Bolan's childhood home, 25|Stoke Newington|Common,|Hackney|.|Bolan was born at|Hackney Hospital|and grew up at 25 Stoke Newington Common, in the borough of|Hackney|, east London, the son of Phyllis Winifred (n\u00e9e Atkins) and Simeon Feld, a lorry driver. His father was an|Ashkenazi Jew|of Russian and Polish ancestry, while his mother was of|English|descent.|[7]|[8]|Moving to|Wimbledon|, southwest London, he fell in love with the rock and roll of|Gene Vincent|,|Eddie Cochran|,|Arthur Crudup|and|Chuck Berry|and hung around coffee bars such as|the 2i's|in|Soho|.|[9]|Bolan was a pupil at Northwold Primary School, Upper Clapton. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a|skiffle|band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\", a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old|Helen Shapiro|. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.|[10]|He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show|Orlando|, dressed as a|mod|. Bolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows.|Town|magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. When asked about his sexuality during an interview in 1975, Bolan said that he was bisexual.|[11]|Music career|[|edit|]|1964\u20131967: Early career|[|edit|]|In 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero,|Cliff Richard|, the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.|Bolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor|Allan Warren|, who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then \n-current source of inspiration,|Bob Dylan|. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.|[12]|Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"|Blowin' in the Wind|\" and|Dion|'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of|Betty Everett|'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.|Warren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul|David Kirch|, in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.|[13]|[14]|[15]|The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.|He signed to|Decca Records|in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from|James Bolam|, that it was a contraction of Bob Dylan, and \u2013 according to Bolan himself \u2013 that Decca Records chose the name.|[16]|He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with|the Ladybirds|on backing vocals (later finding fame with|Benny Hill|), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured|Jimmy Page|and|Big Jim Sullivan|, was produced by Jim Economides, with music director|Mike Leander|. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and|Donovan|. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In\", written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary|Fred Neil|, was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the|beat poets|. Neither song made the charts.|[9]|In 1966, Bolan turned up at|Simon Napier-Bell|'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album|The Beginning of Doves|). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death\", was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album|You Scare Me to Death|. Napier-Bell managed|the Yardbirds|and|John's Children|and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"|Desdemona|\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".|His tenure with the band was brief. Following an ill-fated German tour with|the Who|, Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (|The Krakenmist|and|Pictures Of Purple People|) as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth \u2013 he famously claimed to have spent time with a|wizard|in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that appeared on his first albums with|T. Rex|.|[9]|1967\u20131970: Tyrannosaurus Rex|[|edit|]|Bolan left John's Children when, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label|Track Records|. Unperturbed, he rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer|Steve Peregrin Took|and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in|Melody Maker|to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"|[9]|Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a|psychedelic|-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because Track Records had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"|[9]|The original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex with Took released three albums; two reached the top fifteen in the UK Albums Chart. They also had a top 40 hit \"Debora\" in 1968. They were supported with airplay by|BBC Radio 1|DJ|John Peel|.|[17]|One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free|Hyde Park concert|in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969\u201370 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.|[18]|It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.|[19]|In keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white|Fender|Stratocaster|decorated with a|paisley|teardrop motif from|Syd Barrett|. After replacing Took with|Mickey Finn|, he let the electric influences come forward even further on|A Beard of Stars|, the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by|Jimi Hendrix|.|[9]|1971\u20131975: T. Rex, glam rock and other styles|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan, the pixie prince of|glam rock|, remains a huge influence in music and fashion.|\u2014|Adam Sweeting|,|The Telegraph|.|[20]|Becoming more adventurous musically, Bolan bought a modified vintage|Gibson Les Paul|guitar (featured on the cover of the album|T. Rex|), and then wrote and recorded his first hit \"|Ride a White Swan|\", which was dominated by a rolling hand-clapping back-beat, Bolan's electric guitar and Finn's percussion. At this time he also shortened the group's name to T. Rex.|[9]|Bolan and his producer|Tony Visconti|oversaw the session for \"Ride a White Swan\", the single that changed Bolan's career which was inspired in part by|Mungo Jerry|'s success with \"|In the Summertime|\", moving Bolan away from predominantly acoustic numbers to a more electric sound.|[21]|Recorded on 1 July 1970 and released later that year, it made slow progress in the|UK Top 40|, until it finally peaked in early 1971 at number two.|[22]|Inspired by his muse, June Child, Bolan developed a fascination with women's clothing, an unlikely characteristic for a British male rocker at the time.|[23]|Bolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and|T. Rex|by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist|Steve Currie|and drummer|Bill Legend|, and cutting a five-minute single, \"|Hot Love|\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"|Hey Jude|\". Bolan performed \"Hot Love\" on the BBC television show|Top of the Pops|wearing glitter on his face: the performance was later recognized as the foundation of glam rock.|[3]|[24]|For the viewers, it was a defining moment: \"Bolan was magical, but also sexually heightened and|androgynous|\".|[3]|The song was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"|Get It On|\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song, re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the US, reached No. 10 in the|Billboard|Hot 100|in early 1972.|[3]|Dressed in a satin sailor suit, but also \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 with the glittery gold teardrops beneath his eyes. This performance is often acknowledged as the birth of glam. His androgynous style has been an enduring influence on fashion. From Gucci to Saint Laurent, fashion has long drawn inspiration from his style. He knew how to subvert gender norms into fantastical new shapes.|\u2014|Joobin Bekhrad,|The Guardian|, on Bolan's March 1971 appearance on|Top of the Pops|.|[24]|In November 1971, the band's record label,|Fly|, released the|Electric Warrior|track \"|Jeepster|\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for|EMI|, who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK.|In 1972, he achieved two more UK number ones with \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" taken from|The Slider|,  and two number twos in \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\".|[22]|In the same year he appeared in|Born to Boogie|, a documentary by|Ringo Starr|about T. Rex including a concert filmed at London's|Wembley Empire Pool|in March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at|John Lennon|'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and|Elton John|on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit. No T. Rex record was certified until 1985, as the record company has to pay for it, which Bolan's did not in the '70s.|[22]|Bolan took to wearing top hats and feather boas on stage as well as putting drops of glitter on each of his|cheekbones|. Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this \u2013 some say it was introduced by his|personal assistant|, Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on|Radio 1|that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then.  Other performers \u2013 and their fans \u2013 soon took up variations on the idea.|An outfit of Marc Bolan's on display at the|Hard Rock Cafe|in Sydney, Australia|The glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend|David Bowie|, whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which continued throughout his career. Bowie's 1972 song \"|All the Young Dudes|\"|name-checked|T. Rex.|[25]|Bowie's song \"|Lady Stardust|\" is generally interpreted as alluding to fellow glam rock icon Bolan. The original demo version was entitled \"He Was Alright (A Song for Marc)\"|[26]|In 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend|Jeff Lynne|on the|Electric Light Orchestra|songs \"|Ma-Ma-Ma Belle|\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from|On the Third Day|, as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.|[22]|For the following recording sessions, he recruited|soul|female singers for the backing vocals on \"|20th Century Boy|\", which peaked at number 3 in March, and mid-year \"The Groover\" which went to number four.|[22]|Tanx|, parts of which found him heading towards soul, funk and gospel, was both a commercial and critical success in several European countries. \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"|Teenage Dream|\" from the 1974 album|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend|Gloria Jones|on keyboards as well as backing vocals.|Eventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Jones, which began in July 1973. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums, putting|R & B|influences with rock on|Bolan's Zip Gun|. He was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working.|[9]|1976\u20131977: resurgence and final year|[|edit|]|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014|In September 1975 Gloria Jones gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from|tax exile|in the US and|Monaco|and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show|Supersonic|, directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, including \"New York City\" which reached the top 15. By then, Bolan was current with the music scene, incorporating disco elements in|Futuristic Dragon|and the single \"|Dreamy Lady|\". The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album,|Dandy in the Underworld|, and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along|punk|band|the Damned|as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday barely five years previously.|[9]|Later in 1977,|Granada Television|commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called|Marc|in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on|ITV|earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former|John's Children|\u2013bandmate|Andy Ellison|, then fronting the band|Radio Stars|.|[9]|Bolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival David Bowie was the final guest on the last episode of|Marc|. Bowie's solo song|\"Heroes\"|was the show's penultimate song; Bolan signed off, naming some of the musicians: \"All the cats; you know who they are\"; they then began to play a bluesy song, over the closing credits. After four words of Bowie's vocals, however, Bolan stumbled forward, and off the stage, but managed to grab the microphone, and find a smile. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.|[27]|Personal life|[|edit|]|Bolan began his first serious romantic relationship, with Teresa Whipman, in 1965.|[28]|They broke up in 1968 when Bolan met June Ellen Child. The pair immediately fell in love and moved into a flat together after only knowing each other for a few days.|[29]|They married on 30 January 1970.|[30]|She was a former secretary to his then managers,|Blackhill Enterprises|, also the managers of another of his heroes,|Syd Barrett|, whom June dated.|[31]|She was also influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.|[9]|Bolan's relationship with June was tumultuous; he engaged in several affairs over the course of their marriage, including one with singer|Marsha Hunt|in 1969, and another with artist|Barbara Nessim|while recording in America in 1971.|[32]|[33]|The couple separated in 1973, after June found out about Bolan's affair with his backing singer|Gloria Jones|.|[34]|After Bolan's death, June revealed that she had  abortions during their marriage because she believed Bolan was not mature enough to be a father.|[35]|[36]|Bolan and Gloria Jones were in a committed romantic relationship from 1973 until he died in September 1977.|[37]|The couple had a son together in September 1975 and the three of them lived together as a|nuclear family|for nearly two years until Bolan's death. At the end of June 1976, June Bolan sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery, citing Gloria Jones as the third party. At the court hearing on 5 October 1976, Deputy Judge Donald Ellison declared: \"I am satisfied that the husband committed adultery with the co-respondent, and that the wife finds it intolerable to live with him\", and granted a decree nisi. Twelve months after that date, it was to become a decree absolute thus severing the Bolans' matrimonial ties. \"The facts are that she initially left me, and we just grew apart,\" Bolan explained after the ruling. \"There were no great scenes, no smashing things up. It just suddenly happened one day. We weren't a couple anymore.\" He also used the opportunity to shed a little light on his sexuality. \"Anyway, I'm gay,\" he only half-jested. \"I can't say I was a latent homosexual \u2013 I was an early one. But sex was never a great problem. I'm a great screwer\". Asked about the institution of marriage, he replied: \"Gloria doesn't want to get married and neither do I. If I ever marry anyone again, I'll put in a clause that when it ends you're on your own \u2013 and that means financially, too.\"|[38]|Death|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|at the site where he died in a car crash in|Barnes, London|on 16 September 1977, two weeks shy of what would have been his 30th birthday.|Bolan never learnt to drive, fearing a premature death.|[39]|[40]|Despite this fear, cars or automotive components are at least mentioned in, if not the subject of, many of his songs. He also owned a number of vehicles, including a white 1960s|Rolls-Royce|that was loaned by his management to the band|Hawkwind|on the night of his death.|[41]|[42]|On 16 September 1977, Bolan was a passenger in a|Mini 1275GT|driven by Gloria Jones as they headed home from Mortons club and restaurant in|Berkeley Square|. Both had been drinking wine, and after she crossed a small|humpback bridge|near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, the car struck a fence post|[43]|and then a tree.|[44]|[45]|Bolan was killed instantly, while Jones suffered a broken arm and broken jaw.|[43]|[45]|The car crash site has become a shrine to his memory, where fans leave tributes beside the tree. In 2013, the shrine was featured on the|BBC Four|series|Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places|.|[46]|The site,|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|, is owned and maintained by the T. Rex Action Group.|[47]|Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Crematorium|Memorial plaque to Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium|His funeral service was held on 20 September 1977 at the|Golders Green Crematorium|in|North London|, where his ashes were later buried under a rose bush. At Bolan's funeral, attended by David Bowie,|Rod Stewart|,|Tony Visconti|and|Steve Harley|,|[48]|a swan-shaped floral tribute was displayed outside the service in recognition of his breakthrough hit single \"|Ride a White Swan|\".|There are two plaques dedicated to his memory at the Crematorium. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on\u00a0\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.|Bolan had arranged a discretionary|trust|to safeguard his money. A small, separate|Jersey|-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330\u00a0million (approx $38\u00a0\u2013 $57\u00a0million), remains in trust.|[49]|Legacy|[|edit|]|The T. Rex singer captivated generations with his strutting music and hyper-sexual charisma.|\u2014|Alexis Petridis|in|The Guardian|on \"glam's greatest icon\".|[3]|Bolan strongly influenced artists of many genres, including glam rock,|punk|,|post-punk|,|new wave|,|indie rock|,|Britpop|and|alternative rock|. After seeing Bolan wearing|Zandra Rhodes|-designed outfits,|Freddie Mercury|enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next|Queen|tour in 1974.|[50]|Bolan was the early guitar idol of|Johnny Marr|, who later found fame as the guitarist of the influential|indie rock|band|the Smiths|.|[51]|In 1979,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to the single \"|The Staircase (Mystery)|\". The band had played the song live for several months and on the first anniversary of Bolan's death in 1978 played the song as the encore when they performed at Aylesbury Friars. Emerging in the|New Romantic|movement in the early 1980s,|Boy George|spoke of the impact Bolan and Bowie had on him: \"They represented a kind of bohemian existence that I \u2013 at that point \u2013 could only imagine living. I loved the music. The first time I ever saw Marc Bolan really, properly was singing 'Metal Guru' and just loved him. I don't think you can separate an artist from what they wear or what they sing \u2013 it's kind of the complete package.\"|[52]|In December 1980, \"Telegram Sam\" was the fourth single released by British gothic rock band|Bauhaus|. Also in 1980,|the Bongos|were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the|Billboard|charts with a T.Rex cover. Since then, Bongos frontman|Richard Barone|has recorded several other Bolan compositions (\"The Visit,\" \"Ballrooms of Mars\"), worked with T.Rex producer|Tony Visconti|for his current solo album,|Glow|(2010,|Bar/None Records|) that includes a remake of Bolan's \"Girl\" from|Electric Warrior|, and has himself produced tracks for Bolan's son Rolan. In 1983,|NWOBHM|band|Girlschool|covered \"20th Century Boy\" on their|Play Dirty|.

They also performed the tune (with|Michael Des Barres|replacing Palmer) at the|Live Aid|concert. In 1986,|Violent Femmes|covered the song \"Children of the Revolution\" on their album,|The Blind Leading the Naked|.|[54]|In 1989,|X|released a live cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to their single \"|Kurenai|\".

          "|Willner assembled the album because he felt Bolan was an overlooked figure: he noted that he \u201cwas hardly ever talked about as a composer\u201d, the conversation more often turning to \u201chow David Bowie took his essence and Bolan was in his shadow\u201d. That is certainly true in the US, where Get It on was T Rex\u2019s solitary hit, but the degree of enthusiasm the artists involved have for Bolan\u2019s work is enough to startle even a diehard T Rex obsessive like me.|Kesha was born a decade after|Bolan\u2019s death in 1977 in a car crash|and first heard T Rex in the early 00s. \u201cI just remember thinking, whatever this music was, it was the soundtrack of my soul: it really helped me unleash things inside me. I feel like I was raised by T Rex, because I didn\u2019t have a dad, so male figures in my life were the ones I\u2019d read about or listen to.\u201d|\u2018I feel like I was raised by T Rex\u2019 ... Kesha.|Photograph: Dana Trippe|What continues to attract musicians to an artist whose imperial phase lasted barely two years? The music, obviously: the golden run of singles that begins with 1970\u2019s Ride a White Swan and ends with 1973\u2019s 20th Century Boy; the insouciant, sexually charged brilliance of the albums Electric Warrior and The Slider. The image: what the Edge calls \u201cthat transgressional thing of challenging stereotypes and being this ambiguous creature \u2026 that really did create a new kind of space\u201d. The sense that, while other artists ultimately sold more records or had longer careers, it is hard to think of anyone who has been better at actually|being a pop star|than Bolan, with his self-mythologising lyrics \u2013 \u201cI drive a Rolls-Royce / \u2019Cos it\u2019s good for my voice\u201d \u2013 his interviews filled with wild claims and outrageously entertaining lies, his looks, his charisma.|\u201cHe was the perfect pop star,\u201d says John. \u201cHis songs were great, his records rocked, he had attitude, he had performing skills, he looked fabulous, he dressed the part. At a time when I was still becoming|Elton John|, he was a great role model. I thought: \u2018This guy doesn\u2019t give a fuck, he\u2019s just being who he is and he\u2019s loving every single minute of it.\u2019 And that had a great effect on me.\u201d|\u2018Maybe he could be running a cult in Fiji\u2019 ... Devendra Banhart.|Photograph: Ernesto Notarantonio/Ipa/Rex/Shutterstock|For another of the album\u2019s contributors, the singer-songwriter|Devendra Banhart|, part of Bolan\u2019s appeal is \u201cthe idea of switching up your style without any real concern, because he was really going for it\u201d. By the time of his first minor flush of fame in the late 60s, the former Marc Feld had already been a teenage mod who appeared in Town magazine, boasting about how many ties he owned, and a Dylan-inspired folkie called Toby Tyler, before becoming Marc Bolan, the author of two Donovan-esque flop solo singles and the guitarist and second vocalist in the Who-esque troublemakers John\u2019s Children.|Then came Tyrannosaurus Rex, an acoustic duo featuring Bolan and the percussionist Steve Peregrin-Took, but with the former evidently calling all the shots. Perhaps noting that Bolan was less committed to flower power idealism than he was to becoming famous, some areas of London\u2019s hippie counterculture regarded him with a jaundiced eye (\u201cHe was a cocky little shit,\u201d complains one underground luminary in Jonathon Green\u2019s definitive oral history of the era, Days in the Life), but the music Tyrannosaurus Rex made was frequently extraordinary. For an acoustic duo with a penchant for whimsy, they seldom sounded laid back: their songs charge along chaotically, fuelled by riffs and an energy closer to early rock\u2019n\u2019roll than folk.|Watch Nick Cave sing T Rex\u2019s Cosmic Dancer for the new tribute album Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T Rex|\u201cI just thought: \u2018Where the fuck has this come from?\u2019\u201d remembers John. \u201cI suppose it was a little like the Incredible String Band, but they were folkies \u2013 Marc Bolan was something different. He was sitting there in a cloak covered in stars, writing songs that sounded like Chuck Berry, very simple songs.|What?|\u201d|Banhart says: \u201cThe first time I heard Tyrannosaurus Rex, I thought: \u2018I am home. I\u2019m just in love. These are the best lyrics, this is the most fun energy, this is what real punk is to me. The nakedness of it. Led Zeppelin can hide behind these bombastic, heavy, aggressive walls of sound in order to sing about Mordor, but Marc is just singing about this wild, fantastical, Tolkienish world with nothing but the exoticness of his character.|\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the rock\u2019n\u2019roll thing, songs about cars, celebrating the interior of his Mustang Ford: \u2018It\u2019s all put together with alligator leather.\u2019 It isn\u2019t really psychedelic, it\u2019s a very particular thing.\u201d|Team spirit ... with Mickey Finn, who joined Bolan\u2019s band in its Tyrannosaurus Rex guise, in 1971.|Photograph: Araldo di Crollalanza/Rex|Over four albums, and with the help of|the producer Tony Visconti|, Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s sound expanded, Bolan gradually cranking up his electric guitar. You can hear vague intimations of what was going to happen \u2013 on the 1969 single King of the Rumbling Spires and on A Beard of Stars, the first album Bolan recorded with the percussionist Mickey Finn replacing Peregrin-Took \u2013 but clearly no one expected Ride a White Swan, the first release under the snappier name T Rex: sharper, more streamlined, more poppy, every instrument drenched in the kind of slapback echo found on old rock\u2019n\u2019roll records. The lyrics still sounded hippyish, but if any record can claim to have announced the arrival of the 70s, it is Ride a White Swan. \u201cI heard John Peel play it and I thought: \u2018This is amazing,\u2019\u201d says John. \u201cIt sounded like something that had come down from a spaceship; it was so out-there.\u201d|Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us|The Edge|It eventually reached No 2. Bolan expanded T Rex\u2019s lineup, bringing in the drummer Bill Legend and the bassist Steve Currie, and overhauled his image at the behest of his manager\u2019s wife, Chelita Secunda \u2013 out with the hippy cloaks, in with girls\u2019 clothes, satin and makeup (\u201cHe wore makeup during the day,\u201d remembers John, \u201cwhich I\u2019d never seen a man do before \u2013 I thought that was so cool\u201d). He played on his looks, amped up the sexuality in his music \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m gonna SUCK you,\u201d he howled on Jeepster \u2013 and that was that for the next two years: four No 1 singles, three No 1 albums, a film directed by Ringo Starr, hysteria the press called T Rextasy. There was far more depth to his songs than he was given credit for at the time \u2013 as Banhart points out, between \u201cthe flashiness, the smart lines, the cool boasts\u201d, there was a curious darkness in his lyrics: \u201cAll schools are strange\u201d, \u201cI danced myself into the tomb\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I\u2019m like me\u201d. Perhaps people couldn\u2019t hear over the screaming.|\u2018An understanding that things could be magical\u2019 ... U2\u2019s the Edge.|Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty Images|\u201cIt felt like he actually cast a spell,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt every aspect of how he presented himself was just an outpouring of his understanding that things could be magical, things could be heightened. Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us.\u201d|And then it went wrong. His grip on the songwriting he had honed to a kind of minimalist perfection on 1972\u2019s Metal Guru \u2013 a single that sounds like one long chorus \u2013 faltered. Bolan was rattled by his failure to break the US. \u201cI think he was just too androgynous for a lot of folks here,\u201d suggests Joan Jett, another Angelheaded Hipster contributor, who says Bolan was her first teenage crush. \u201cRadio just went for the safer stuff. I know from being in the Runaways how everyone treated us, so I just know they would have had issues with a Marc Bolan type of guy.\u201d|Bolan with his partner Gloria Jones, a former Motown staff writer.|Photograph: Estate of Keith Morris/Redferns|He was|smart enough to call time on glam|with 1974\u2019s elegiac single Teenage Dream and sharp enough to spot that the next thing might be a kind of rock/soul hybrid some time before his longstanding frenemy David Bowie decamped to Philadelphia. But having had the right idea, he couldn\u2019t quite make it work.|Bowie\u2019s Young Americans|sounded like an effortless reinvention. For all the bona fides of his|new partner Gloria Jones|\u2013 a former staff writer at Motown \u2013 Bolan\u2019s brand of plastic soul often felt like hard going, overstuffed with ideas. The other members of T Rex left, one by one, leaving him to front a band of session musicians. Tony Visconti baled out after 1974\u2019s poorly received Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow, claiming Bolan would no longer listen to anyone but yes-men.|Occasionally, something sparked, as on 1975\u2019s brilliant Think Zinc, but the album it came from, Bolan\u2019s Zip Gun, failed to chart.|Still, a prevailing wind started blowing in his favour once more. He had a couple of strong hits, New York City and I Love to Boogie, curbed the excesses that had left him looking bloated and finally nailed the soul-inspired sound on his great 1976 album Futuristic Dragon. Moreover, the emerging punk scene was staffed by people who had grown up in front of Top of the Pops at the height of T Rextasy and taken notes: three chords, distorted guitars, killer singles, be outrageous. Under punk\u2019s scorched-earth policy, vast tranches of rock\u2019s past were dismissed: T Rex were not.|\u201cThere was incredible discipline in T Rex\u2019s work,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cElectric Warrior is full of what I would call rock\u2019n\u2019roll 45s, which is such a rare thing: using rock and blues and guitar, but not losing sight of making great, accessible songs that have hooks and ideas and groove. They were an amazing band from that point of view, and that\u2019s the thing that I think a lot of rock lost sight of, progressive rock and whatever \u2013 whatever it was, it was not sexy music. I think the T Rex discipline is what gave them the chance to survive.\u201d|The admiration was mutual. Most established artists mocked or dismissed punk, or simply looked on with detached bemusement. Bolan, however, jumped in feet first: it seemed to activate the wild enthusiasm that John remembers: \u201cHe was always encouraging, never belittling; being with him was like having a hundred B12 injections at once.\u201d|Happy family ... Bolan and the Ramones in London, 1976.|Photograph: Richard Young/Rex|Bolan was in the audience for the Ramones\u2019 first UK gig. He took the Damned on tour with him and peppered his kids\u2019 TV show, Marc, with appearances by punk bands. You could say the fact that he was now presenting a kids\u2019 TV show was evidence of how far his star had fallen, but Bolan was pretty magnificent on it,|mercilessly hamming it up for the cameras|. \u201cThis is a new group called Generation X. They have a lead singer called Billy Idol who\u2019s supposed to be as pretty as me,\u201d he murmurs, effetely sniffing a flower. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d|A week after recording that link,|Bolan was dead, aged 29|. The premature death of an artist inevitably conjures a lot of what-ifs. It is tempting to wonder what might have happened had Bolan lived to see the glitter-obsessed denizens of the Blitz club and the synth era; to hear the Smiths rewriting Metal Guru as Panic or Get It on recast as Oasis\u2019s Cigarettes and Alcohol; or to enjoy British glam finally gaining US commercial success by proxy thanks to heavy metal: Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Slash stole his image from Bolan\u2019s Slider-era top hat and curls look; Def Leppard\u2019s Joe Elliott claimed that Pour Some Sugar on Me was an attempt to mimic T Rex\u2019s lyrics.|And it is tempting to wonder what Bolan might have made of another pre-eminent musical genius who clearly listened to T Rex, which Prince made explicit when he released his 1991 Bolan homage, Cream. \u201cWhen I met Prince, I thought he was like Marc: ethereal, very androgynous,\u201d says John. \u201cIf you look at the two of them, they\u2019re very similar, the way they posed. I can imagine Prince singing Telegram Sam, I can imagine Marc singing Raspberry Beret.\u201d|Glitter and curls: Marc Bolan and the birth of glam rock style|Read more|The truth is that he would have probably taken it all as his due \u2013 whatever his flaws, being crippled by modesty wasn\u2019t among them \u2013 just as he would taken Angelheaded Hipster and the praise from younger artists. \u201cHis attitude has really informed the way I look at my life,\u201d says|Kesha|. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t know what to do, like how to feel or how to behave, I think of people like Marc Bolan and all of a sudden it becomes more fun.\u201d|\u201cWhat would he be doing if he were alive today?\u201d muses Banhart. \u201cHe could be what Elon Musk is. Or he could maybe be running a cult in Fiji, with him as the head of his own New Light of Dawn, the head of the Bolarian cult. Maybe he\u2019s the person that they\u2019d hire to do the prequel to Game of Thrones. \u2018George RR Martin, he\u2019s taking too long \u2013 get Bolan on the phone.\u2019\u201d|Those sound like precisely the kind of wild claims Bolan would have made for himself. Banhart laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s it. But he was one of those one-of-a-kind people, where you go: \u2018Yeah, sure, all right. No one else can get away with that. But you can.\u2019\u201d|Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T Rex is out now on BMG|Marc Bolan\u2019s deep cuts, chosen by Alexis Petridis|This playlist largely avoids T Rex\u2019s biggest hits, incredible as they are, in favour of taking a slightly more serpentine path through Bolan\u2019s oeuvre. We open with The Wizard, the solo debut single that began Bolan\u2019s myth-building \u2013 he claimed he had studied sorcery under the titular sorcerer in France; his manager,|Simon Napier-Bell|, unsportingly suggested that Bolan had just met a man who did conjuring tricks in a Paris nightclub. Then there are the fantastic, wild, freakbeat singles Bolan wrote for John\u2019s Children that underlined the impossibility of him ever functioning merely as a band\u2019s backing singer: his voice looms out of the mix, overpowering everything else, a bizarre, quavering bleat he had apparently designed to draw as much attention to himself as possible.|Listen to Alex Petridis\u2019s Marc Bolan playlist|Spotify|The playlist picks its way along Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s path from hippy oddity to proto-glam. You can hear intimations of what was going to happen next on Mustang Ford\u2019s conflation of cars and sex, and in the sound of King of the Rumbling Spires, By the Light of a Magical Moon and Elemental Child. And it takes in Banhart\u2019s favourite Bolan lyric: Scenescof\u2019s distinctly punk \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to dictate all my fun\u201d. Here are 30 reasons to \u2013 as the man himself was fond of saying \u2013 keep a little Marc in your heart.|Topics|Pop and rock|U2|Elton John|Kesha|Devendra Banhart|Celebrity|features|Reuse this content|Most viewed|Most viewed|Film|Music|TV & radio|Books|Art & design|Stage|Games|Classical|News|Opinion|Sport|Culture|Lifestyle|Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning|Sign up for our email|About us|Help|Complaints & corrections|SecureDrop|Work for us|Privacy policy|Cookie policy|Terms & conditions|Contact us|All topics|All writers|Modern Slavery Act|Digital newspaper archive|Facebook|YouTube|Instagram|LinkedIn|Twitter|Newsletters|Advertise with us|Guardian Labs|Search jobs|Patrons|Back to top|\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

          "|Nineteen forty-seven also marked the birth of the semiconductor revolution. Bell Laboratory scientists William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain announced the invention of the Bipolar Junction Transistor. The discovery caused little commotion at the time, but soon everyone would be carrying their own personal transistor radios. Three decades later, semiconductor manufacturers around the world would be spewing out millions of tiny microprocessors, each carrying well over a million transistors and capable of executing over one-hundred-million instructions per second.|In sports, Jackie Robinson became the first black man to sign a contract \nwith a major baseball club and New York beat Brooklyn to win the 1947 \nWorld Series.|Britain had just come through its most severe winter since 1894. But the cold of winter was quickly forgotten as the country prepared itself for a royal wedding between the heir to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, and Philip Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh.|And in the East London suburb of Hackney, a working-class Jewish couple, Simeon and Phyllis Feld, were expecting a child. Phyllis worked days at a fruit stand in Soho while Simeon worked at various odd jobs including cosmetic salesman and truck driver. On September 30th, 1947, the couple gave birth at Hackney General Hospital to a son and they named him Mark.|As far as Mark was concerned, he was born a star. \"When I was younger\", he recalled, \"I certainly thought I was a superior kind of being. And I didn't feel related to other human beings.\" Mark's parents remember him as a very strong willed boy who would kick anyone he didn't like. He had his share of fights during his school years and was a member of a local gang known as the Sharks. On one occasion, Mark claimed to have been knifed during a fight with a rival gang.|Mark had a strong imagination and would often make believe that he was Audie Murphy, Mighty Joe Young, or the Phantom of the Opera. He was also an avid movie fan. He most enjoyed science fiction and horror films and could name every title, actor, producer, and director.|Mark gained an appreciation for music at an early age spending hours listening to his parent's record collection. His favorite was a song about an American frontiersman from Tennessee, a place far away and much different than the London Mark grew up in. The song was \"The Ballad of Davey Crockett\" by an American songwriter named Bill Hayes. Mark's father, eager to encourage his son's interest in music, went out shopping one day to buy another record by his son's favorite musician, but he made an innocent mistake that would change the course of Mark's life forever. Instead of buying another record by Bill Hayes, Simeon confused the name with another American. The artist was Bill Haley and the song was \"Rock Around The Clock\". At age eight, Mark Feld had been handed his calling.|The Young Mark Feld|It didn't take long for Mark to act on his love for music. He first built himself a makeshift guitar which he used to learn the basics. He then talked his indulgent parents into buying him a drum kit. Later, when he was nine they bought him a guitar for 16 pounds which was nearly a month of Simeon's salary.|His mother would later recall how Mark would go to see someone like Cliff Richard in concert and come home saying \"that's how I'll be one day.\" Among his earliest compatriots were Keith Reid, future lyricist for Procul Harum, Cat Stevens, and a young man whose life would often be intertwined with his own, David Bowie.|Mark began to build a record collection with money he made doing odd jobs which included serving espresso behind the counter at the legendary 2 I's on Old Compton Street. The 2 I's served as a launching pad for many famous British acts including a young man named Harry Webb who would later change his name to Cliff Richard. Mark himself auditioned there, supposedly on the same day as did Harry Webb, but was turned down.|At age 12 Mark joined a 3 piece band called Susie and The Hula Hoops as a tea-chest bass player. The band's lead vocalist was named Helen Shapiro. Helen would eventually leave the band and within months record a string of pop-hit singles including two number 1 hits in Britain. Although Mark would deny that it had any impact on him, many believed that her success spurred him on to pursue his own path to stardom. He dropped out of school, having already been expelled, and went in search of an opportunity in acting.|During this time Mark befriended the girls from a British TV show called \"Oh Boy\". The girls would take Mark to all of their performances at the Hackney Empire. It was there that Mark had one of his first face-to-face meetings with a contemporary rock star.|Rock and Roll had been born in the USA and was being exported to\nEurope by a handful of early American rock stars who's popularity\noverseas nearly dwarfed their popularity back home in the States. One\nof these stars was Eddie Cochran and it was he who happened to be at the Hackney Empire on this night for his first Brittish tour.|Eddie Cochran|As the story goes, following Eddie Cochran's performance at the Hackney Empire, Cochran handed his guitar to the then 13 year old starry eyed Mark Feld who proceeded to carry the guitar to Cochran's waiting limousine. It was a moment that Mark was always proud to relate and one that would often be singled out as an important event in Mark's life, as if that event - the act of having touched Eddie Cochran's guitar, had some greater, almost mystical, significance.|This story, unfortunately, has a tragic and perhaps eerily ironic ending. At the end of Cochran's tour of England, the taxi carrying Cochran, his girlfriend Sharon Sheely, and fellow American Rock Star Gene Vincent, blew a tire while on its way to the London Airport. The car swerved off the road and slammed into a lamp post. Several hours later, on April 17th, 1960, Eddie Cochran joined his good friend Buddy Holly on the list of early rockers who gained instant immortality through a tragic death.|At age 13 Mark spotted a man walking down the street in front of his house wearing clothes which would become typical of the Mod movement in Britain. The sight so impressed Mark that he began spending all of his money on similar clothes. Later, commenting on this period of his life, Mark would say that he had an obsession with clothes, owning forty suits and often changing them 4 or 5 times a day. \"I used to go home and literally pray to become a Mod,\" he would remember.|Bumping into Angus McGill one day, a writer for the Evening Standard, Mark bragged about all of the clothes he owned. McGill followed Mark home to see his collection of clothes. Impressed with what he saw, McGill recruited Mark for a feature article about the Mod scene in Town magazine, a forerunner of modern men's magazines such as GQ. The article was entitled 'Faces Without Shadows' and was written by a fellow named Peter Barnsley. It included some of the earliest photographs of Mark to ever appear in print. They were taken by Don McCullin - Later to become a famous war photographer.|Beneath one of the pictures Barnsley included the following paragraph which included a rather ominous prediction:|Mark As Model|\"Feld is fifteen years old, and still at school. His family has just moved from Stamford Hill to a pre-fab out in Wimbledon. Of this he does not approve. The queues of Teds outside the cinemas in Wimbledon look just like a contest for the worst haircut, he says. At least the boys of Stamford hill dress sharply, and who would want a new, clean house if it is in unsympathetic surroundings? Nonetheless cleanliness is of vital importance to him. Shining with soap and health, he is apparently tireless and often goes for days on end without any sleep; there is never a trace of fatigue or boredom in his face.\n\"What is the point of all this energy and all the soap and water? Where is the goal towards which he is obviously running as fast as his impeccably shod feet can carry him? It is nowhere. He is running to stay in the same place and he knows by the time he has reached his mid-twenties the exhausting race will be over and he will have lost.\"|Following these events Mark was introduced to a modeling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\". As such he was used as a model for their suits in their catalogues as well as a model for cardboard cutouts to be displayed in their shop windows. Whether because they were unimpressed or because they wanted to keep their catalogue fresh with new faces is uncertain, but he was never used again.|Mark then shifted his focus back towards music and, at age 17, made another attempt to kick-start a career in the business. Sporting a denim cap and playing an acoustic guitar, he decided to try his hand at the British folk circuit. The sound resembled a Dylan/Donovan mix and, indeed, his songs consisted of some Dylan covers and a few other folksy tunes. To complete the new look and sound, Mark even came up with a new name for himself. Thus it was that the short music career of Toby Tyler began.|Mark as Toby Tyler|It didn't take long until Toby met up with an actor named Allan Warren\nwho offered to become his manager. Allan helped arrange recording time\nfor Toby and they proceeded to record several tunes including Dylan's\n\"Blowin' in the wind\". A version of Betty Everett's \"You're No Good\"\nwas submitted to EMI for a test screening but they turned Toby\ndown. Deciding that the future for Toby Tyler looked bleak, Warren and\nToby parted company after which Toby Tyler once again became simply\nMark Feld. (There was one small change however, but it's not clear to\nme when exactly it occurred. And that is that somewhere around this\ntime period, Mark chose to drop the \"k\" from his name and replace it with a\n\"c\". Therefore, many poems and diaries from this period were signed as\nMarc Feld rather than as Mark Feld.)|The tapes produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished from thought and mind for over twenty-five years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly eight-thousand dollars. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available the earliest of Marc's known recordings.|With yet another attempt to get into the music business at a dead end, Marc found himself hanging around the National Theatre looking for work. He was able to land several character parts in some TV shows including a delinquent on the Sam Kydd TV series and a show called 'Orlando'. But TV acting bored Marc so he decided to take an extended trip to France.|The accounts of what happened in France differ and not even Marc ever seemed to tell the same story twice. He was known to occasionally stretch the truth or fabricate pieces of it and seemed to often forget which parts were real and which were fantasies. He once admitted to an interviewer that he felt that his credibility as a poet allowed him to stretch the truth or make things up.|In any case, according to Marc's accounts he met a magician who lived\nin a 40 room mansion with libraries of books on mythology and black\nmagic. Marc claimed to have witnessed levitations, seances, and\ncrucifixions of live cats. He even claimed to have at one point\nwitnessed a ceremony at which the attendees resorted to consumption of\nhuman flesh. All of this, recall, was from Marc's own\naccounts. According to one of Marc's early producers, Simon\nNapier-Bell, however, Marc had merely met a guy who did magic tricks\nand spent a weekend with him.|Whatever the real truth, the experience had a profound effect on Marc. He left France with a much more highly developed imagination and a near obsession with Greek mythology, British romantic poetry, and the Tolkien books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of The Rings\". The Tolkien books had reached nearly Biblical status with the sixties generation of hippies and they would have a tremendous influence on Marc's early song writing; manifesting themselves in the form of enchanted poems and lyrics.|Marc returned to Britain more determined than ever to become a star. He locked himself away for months writing songs in a manic frenzy of inspiration. His future wife would later describe his writing style in terms of \"a force flowing out of him\". He himself contributed it to the work of his Guardian Angel whom, he was sure, really did all of the writing. During this period of time, Marc would churn out a reservoir of songs which he would still be tapping into five albums later. Among them was a song which he entitled \"The wizard\" in honor of his wizardly friend in France. With the help of producer Jim Economedies, he recorded the song and landed a record contract with Decca.|When Marc received the initial samples of \"The Wizard\" from Decca he\nreceived a mild shock. His name had been changed again; but this time\nwithout his approval. Decca had decided that the name Marc Feld would\nNOT do and had changed his last name to \"Bowland\". The name change\ndidn't bother Marc as much as did the fact that he had not been\nconsulted about the matter. As would become typical of other events in\nhis future, Marc refused to allow Decca to have it their way without\nhis stamp of approval. After negotiations, he convinced them to drop\nthe W and the D from Bowland to shorten the name to BOLAN. Thus, Marc\nFeld became Marc Bolan and in November of 1965 \"The Wizard\" was\nreleased and the voice and music of Marc Bolan was broadcast for the\nfirst time over British airwaves.|Mark Feld as Marc Bolan|Decca's press release on the Wizard single was a masterpiece of sixties hype. It read:|\"Marc Bolan was born in September 1947. After 15 years had passed he traveled to Paris and met a black magician called The Wizard, He lived for 18 months in The Wizard's chateau with Achimedies, an owl, and the biggest, whitest Siamese cat you ever saw. He then felt the need to spend some time alone so he made his way to woods, near Rome. For two weeks he strove to find himself and then he returned to London where he began to write. His writings mirror his experiences with mentionings of the magician's pact with the great god Pan. In London, walking down Kings Road, Chelsea in the dead of night, he chanced to meet a girl named Lo-og who gave him a magic cat. This cat, named after the girl, is now his constant companion and is a source of inspiration to him. Now The Wizard's tale is set down for all to hear on Marc's first recording for Decca.\"|A small poem accompanied two photographs of Bolan. It read:|\"Standing alone in the wood, with the golden palace bleeding scarlet tears into the sunset, I thought of all the treasures in the magic palace. And all the emptiness in my stomach and I smiled secretly, Rememberin' the wizard's words.\"|A critic for Disc Magazine reviewed the Wizard as follows:|\"On the strength of this strange young man's looks and weird background I suspect we'll hear more of this odd record about meeting a Wizard in the woods who knew all. I prefer the other side, 'Beyond the Risin' Sun' which has more tune. Jim Economedies, ace producer, does lovely things on this. I'm a bit put off by the way this boy sings with Dylan phrasing but that's all.\"|A record contract doesn't mean instant success and Marc found himself hustling for interviews and write-ups. One of his first interviews as Marc Bolan was with Angus McGill, the same writer who had interviewed Marc years earlier about the Mod trend. According to Angus he simply did not recognize the new Marc. \"I had remembered him as a rather plain little chap\", he said, \"and suddenly there was the most glamorous young man you'd ever seen, all curls and exotic clothes. He played the record, which I thought was appalling and showed me some poetry which struck me as unmitigated rubbish. I never thought he'd make it. But then I once predicted that TV would never catch on either.\"|Keith Altham, Marc's future publicist who at this point in time was just an acquaintance, remembers Marc frequenting a bar called the Brewmaster. He would come in carrying his record and say \"Gotta listen to this fellas, I'm going to be the greatest thing since Elvis Presley.\" \"Nice little bloke Marc!\", they all thought, \"Sit down and have a Coca Cola.\" No one really expected him to get too far.|Marc performed \"The Wizard\" on the TV show \"Ready, Steady, Go\". Unfortunately, the band missed out on the intro, played too fast, and in the wrong key. To make matters worse the show encountered technical problems and the signal went dead for most of Marc's debut. It was a disaster.|In June of 66 Decca released a follow up single called \"The Third Degree\" backed by what Marc called an unfinished demo titled \"San Francisco Poet\". It flopped. This single was to have been followed up by a song called \"Jasper C. Debussy\" but by then Marc's contract with Decca had expired and Marc had moved on to Columbia and producer Simon Napier-Bell.|Following his lack of success with Decca, Marc called producer Simon Napier-Bell and told him \"I'm a singer and I'm going to be the biggest rock star ever, so I need a good manager to make all the arrangements.\" Simon told him to send him his demo tapes but Marc insisted that he was close by and could just drop them in. Ten minutes later he arrived at Simon's office with his guitar around his neck and announced that he had no demo tapes after all but would be happy to sing a few tunes for him. He sat in a chair cross-legged, accentuating his short stature, and played all the songs on acoustic guitar - enough, according to Simon, to fill nearly four albums. By the end of the set, Simon was on the phone booking some time in a local recording studio.|Simon recalled that Marc was ridiculously egotistical at the time, to the point where it was easy to get furious with him. He actually thought that all he needed to do was to make a few posters of himself and things would just sort of happen. Simon disagreed and convinced Mark to add some strings to one of the songs, called \"hippy gumbo\", and approach some record companies with it.|Unfortunately, none of the record companies liked the tune. When Simon told Marc the news, he was completely shattered - not even expecting to be turned down. Eventually however, Simon was able to convince Columbia records to take Marc on and the single was released in June of '67. This single was another flop and was greeted with bad reviews including one that called the single, quote, \"a crazed mixture of an incredibly bad negro blues singer and Larry the Lamb.\"|Marc made a second appearance on \"Ready, Steady, Go\" to promote 'Hippy Gumbo'. This appearance went much better than his first but it was overshadowed by the first British TV appearance of Jimi Hendrix. Marc later boasted that Hendrix told him how much he liked his voice but that he would never make it. In some respects this prediction was true in as much as by mid 1967 the short solo career of Marc Bolan had failed to take root.|Simon Napier-Bell happened to be producing two other groups at this point in time. One was The Yardbirds, which included future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Watching the Yardbirds work was one of the things Marc would later recall as one of the highlights of this period. The other band was a group called John's Children who were signed to the Who's label, Track.|John's Children had previously been known as the Silence which had developed from a number of even earlier bands such as the Clockwork Onions and The Few. The name John's Children came about because bass player John Hewlett was the leader of the band. The other band members were lead singer Andy Ellison, guitarist Geoff McClelland, and drummer Chris Townsen who occasionally deputized for the Who's Keith Moon. The band had already caused quite a stir in England after having done some nude publicity shots and performing some relatively wild stage acts. Today they are remembered as one of the first psychedelic bands of this era.|John's children had already released two singles. One was called \"The Love I Thought I'd Found\" which was released in America retitled as \"Smashed!! Blocked!!\". The second single was called \"Not The Sort Of Girl You Take To Bed\" which flopped. Following these two singles guitarist Geoff McClelland was kicked out of the band, having failed to live up to the expectations of his fellow band members or the owner of the Track record label, Kit Lambert, who was also the Who's manager at the time.|In addition to the Who, Lambert had signed Jimi Hendrix and John's Children to his record label but insisted that Marc Bolan be included in the deal as John's Children's guitarist. The deal was acceptable to Simon-Napier Bell who, having failed to make Marc Bolan a solo success, saw a union between John's Children and Marc as a move that would potentially benefit both parties. John's children would have a better guitarist as well as one that could write music and Marc could broaden his exposure by joining up with a band that had already established a following. Marc found the deal acceptable if for no other reason than he would be recording on the same record label as Jimi Hendrix whom he had immense respect for.|Bolan Era John's Children|The merger was made and the new line up of John's Children headed for the recording studio to put down some new tracks. After one week they emerged with several demos and releasable songs. The first to be released was a Bolan compilation called Desdemona. Andy Ellison performed the lead vocals on the song but Bolan's unique voice was unmistakably present on the background vocals. The single was released in May of '67 and initially appeared to be headed for the top of the charts. Unfortunately, The BBC dealt the song a fatal blow by banning the song because it considered the line \"lift up your skirt and fly\" to be offensive. Despite this the song was popular and to this day is considered to be one of the finest British releases of 1967.|Onstage, John's children were as controversial as their music. Andy Ellison was prone to getting excessively wild, jumping around the stage, leaping into the crowd and occasionally attacking other members of the band. Marc would swing between moods sometimes simply sitting cross-legged on the stage and other times running around the stage in circles.|In their private lives, however, Marc was clearly apart from the others. Andy Ellison would later recall that the rest of the band was into drugs and dropping acid while Marc would only occasionally sip a little wine and spent most of his time simply writing songs. This, among other reasons, was why the merger of Bolan with John's children was to be a relatively short-lived union.|Marc also grew increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that John, not he, was choosing the musical direction of the band. Their second single with Marc was to have been \"Midsummer Nights Scene\" with \"Sarah Crazy Child\" on the flip side - both Bolan compositions. But, for reasons that are still unclear, the single was shelved at the last minute even though it had already been pressed. In its place was released a Hewlett/Townsen number called \"Come And Play With Me In The Garden\".|Then, perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back, a concert in Ludswigshaven, Germany while touring Europe with the Who, nearly ended in disaster. Near the end of their set the band jumped into a song entitled \"You're a Nothing\" which ended with a repeated German chant. Andy Ellison grew quite a bit more wild than usual and jumped off the stage with a large sack of feathers that he had pulled from hotel pillows. While he went about the business of tossing feathers at the crowd, Marc began beating at his amps with chains, and the rest of the band began chanting the German slogan. Eventually, a riot broke out. Fans began to rush the stage and the band just narrowly made an escape to the safety of their limousines. They drove off just as the police began moving in armored cars to quell the riot. The Who had to cancel their act that night and the German government confiscated a good deal of John's Children's equipment.|Marc left the band soon after - less than 6 months after joining it.|But he left John's Children with a mission - to establish his own rock band under his own complete control. Still wielding the electric guitars and amps he had used with John's children, Marc put ads in the International Times looking for other musicians. Not patient enough to wait, he also booked a gig at the Electric Garden in London's Covent Garden, a club that would later change its name to \"Middle Earth\" after the mythical land in the Tolkien trilogies.|An 18 year old drummer named Steve Turner responded to the add. Marc hired him but convinced him to change his name to Steve Peregrine Took after the youngest of the four hobbits in the Lord of The Rings trilogy. The name change was fine for Steve apparently as long as Marc didn't mind being referred to as Nalob Cram - Marc Bolan spelled backwards.|Steve Peregrine Took|In addition to bringing a full drumkit to the band, Steve Took could also acceptably integrate several other strange instruments into the music such as kazoos and pixiephones. He could also handle backing vocals quite well being able to immediately find a harmony for nearly anything Marc sang. According to Marc's soon to be producer Tony Visconti, Steve was perhaps the only person who was ever able to really get inside Marc's head and travel the distance into the Middle Earth landscape where most of his musical themes took place.|In addition to Steve, Marc recruited a 28 year old bearded guitarist named Ben who, according to Steve, kept turning green with stomach ulcers and a bass guitarist who was also a lot older than Marc and Steve and smoked a pipe which clearly labeled him as an undesirable - or at least so thought Steve. There was one other member of the band, but little is documented or remembered about him. In fact, the identities of all three of these original band members remains a mystery today.|Marc needed a name for this new band. Naturally he wanted a name that reflected his belief in mythology but knew that most people didn't adhere to such beliefs. But Marc reasoned that modern science had firmly proven the existence of the dinosaurs; creatures that, far more than anything else known to man, encroached on the boundaries of mythology. And if such creatures had existed millions of years ago, then who could argue against the possibility that even long before they existed there may have been creatures more like fire breathing dragons and other mythological creatures. Following this reasoning, Marc decided to name his band after a dinosaur. But not just any dinosaur would do. It had to be the biggest and baddest of them all - the king of the dinosaurs; the Tyrannosaurus Rex.|With a new band and a new name, Marc headed for the Covent Garden. Time didn't allow for such trivialities as rehearsing so the band practiced together only once before the show. The result was disastrous. The band members were simply incompatible and the total lack of rehearsal understandably didn't help. The band was promptly booed off the stage and disbanded almost immediately afterwards. To make matters worse, Track records, who owned most of what remained of John's Children's equipment following the German fiasco, repossessed Marc's electric guitar and amps. Then, to scrape up enough cash to obtain the bare necessities of life, Steve had to sell his drumkit and replaced it with a simple pair of bongos.|Thus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, which Marc had started with the best of\nintentions, had disintegrated into a 2 piece band owning only a set of\nbongos and an acoustic guitar. They may well have vanished from the\nmusic histories altogether had it not been for the support of a very\nearly ally and big fan - radio disk jockey|John Peel|.|Tyrannosaurus Rex|John had operated an illegal offshore radio station which was eventually shut down by the BBC. But being illegal allowed Peel to play lots of music NOT allowed or sanctioned by the BBC including underground bands like Tyrannosaurus Rex. After the offshore radio was shut down, Peel was hired by the Middle Earth club and immediately recruited the fledgling Tyrannosaurus Rex as a house band. Later, after landing a job at Radio One, John would often invite Tyrannosaurus Rex to play live on his show. Some of these recordings along with those from many other bands are currently available on a series of albums and CDs known as the Peel sessions. John also made sure that whenever he was asked to MC at clubs throughout England, Tyrannosaurus Rex was brought along as his warm-up band. Eventually, this exposure began to build a following for the band and they were soon being asked to play at various colleges and open air festivals around England. They even appeared at the first free Hyde Park festival in 1968.|Thus, with John Peel's help, Marc's Tyrannosaurus Rex survived the Winter of 1968. Aside from a few rough cuts released on an album years later called \"The Beginning of Doves\", little in the form of recordings is available of Tyrannosaurus Rex from those early days and, historically, it's fair to say that Tyrannosaurus Rex was dormant and would remain so until the thaw of spring.\n\n<!-- Play version of \"Beyond the Rising Sun\" on Doves. ->|[Home]|[Next Chapter]",

Photo credit: BBC|T-Rex fans will be delighted with the news that the British glam rockers will \u201cofficially\u201d be acknowledged as rock and roll legends being nominated along with Whitney Houston and Biggie Smalls aka Notorious B.I.G into the 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The significance in this historical moment musically speaking is how the main operator behind the band, Marc Bolan took the definition of what rock and roll is all about to another dimension with his musical range that remains to be impressive by today\u2019s standards.|According to\u00a0Gloria Jones, Bolan\u2019s then girlfriend, bandmate and mother of their son, Rolan Feld Bolan said to|Billboard|,|\u201cHe was a very humble spirit, but he understood who he was. He understood his worth.\u201d Nevertheless, Jones adds, the glam rock pioneer, \u201cwould have been very, very honored, and I\u2019m sure he would have been brought to tears. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very happy, and he\u2019s very honored.\u201d|Why Marc Bolan Remains To Be A Glam Rebelling Rock Icon \u2013 A Flamboyant Identity That Thwarts The Restraints of Society Standards|Marc Bolan was way ahead of his time in his short career as one of the top charting artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
          "|Much has been made of exactly how the glitter ended up on Bolan\u2019s cheeks. In a 1974 BBC interview, Bolan said: \u201cThere was some of my wife\u2019s glitter and I just spit on me fingers and stuck it under me eyes. I thought it looked cute \u2026\u201d|In one Bolan biography, his then wife, June Child, claimed the idea was hers. Numerous sources, however, cite Chelita Secunda, the wife of Bolan\u2019s manager at the time, as the woman behind the glitter. \u201cChelita was a muse to Marc Bolan,\u201d remarked artist Duggie Fields in Michael Bracewell\u2019s book Roxy: The Band That Invented an Era. \u201cIndeed, being the instigator of Marc\u2019s addiction to glitter and women\u2019s clothes, she can be held responsible for much of the look now referred to as glam rock.\u201d In Paul Trynka\u2019s biography, David Bowie: Starman, the DJ Jeff Dexter is quoted as saying that Chelita gave Bolan some glitter at her house, in the presence of Bowie and Elton John. \u201cShe wore glitter herself, and one day she put glitter on Marc. David was there and said, \u2018I want some\u2019, and [Elton] had some too. So the birth of glam rock was definitely at Chelita\u2019s.\u201d|In any case, rock and popular culture would never be the same. Far from being a mere twopenny prince in Persian gloves, as he described himself in Hot Love, Bolan had become the progenitor \u2013 and king \u2013 of glam. \u201cOh man, I need TV when I\u2019ve got T. Rex!\u201d Bowie would later exclaim in his song|All the Young Dudes|.|For the next couple years or so, \u201cT. Rextasy\u201d was all the rage in Britain. In his sparkly lam\u00e9 and plush, leopard-print blazers, feather boas, top hats and mary-jane shoes \u2013 not to mention generous helpings of mascara, eyeshadow and powder \u2013 Bolan belted out hit after catchy hit, looking exquisite.|Satin and tat: Bolan in London in the mid 70s.|Photograph: MARKA/Alamy|\u201cSatin suits and boas and the Anello and Davide mary janes were|his|look\u201d, says designer Anna Sui, who described Bolan as a \u201cperennial\u201d style inspiration. Biba\u2019s founder, Barbara Hulanicki, remembers a sequinned rainbow blazer of hers that Bolan wore in a number of photographs: \u201cHe was small. I have a feeling it came off the girls\u2019 floor. Oh, he looked so amazing in that jacket.\u201d|He also looked conspicuously androgynous for the era, a quality that the writer Simon Reynolds says was one of the things that defined Bolan. Before Bowie\u2019s sexually ambiguous incarnation as Ziggy Stardust or Brian Eno\u2019s colourful gender-bending in Roxy Music, Bolan had popularised an image and attitude untypical of British male rockers. \u201cI think [my use of glitter] caused a change \u2026 especially with cosmetics,\u201d Bolan said in the BBC interview \u201cGuys could go out on stage \u2026 being not|effeminate|, but not necessarily having to have Brut aftershave on \u2013 you know, super-masculine. You could use makeup and you could use [other such] things to brighten the act.\u201d|T. Rextasy was all too brief, as was Bolan\u2019s life, which ended in 1977, when girlfriend Gloria Jones crashed into a tree exactly two weeks before his 30th birthday. Like his music, the style he pioneered continues to influence. Alongside Gucci and Saint Laurent, labels such as Hedi Slimane\u2019s Celine and Halpern have at times drawn inspiration from Bolan\u2019s preference for chunky platforms, feather boas and snakeskin prints. See also The Temples frontman James Bagshaw (a dead ringer for Bolan) and Annie Clark (AKA St Vincent), in whom echoes of Bolan can sometimes be seen, as well as even the \u201csuper-masculine\u201d Slash \u2013 who for decades has mirrored Bolan\u2019s leather top hat-and-curly mop look on the cover of his 1972 album The Slider|.|As Bolan said of his glittery Top of the Pops performance: \u201cLook what happened to the world after that!\u201d|AngelHeaded Hipster|, a tribute album featuring Mark Almond, Elton John, Nick Cave and others, is due out on BMG on 4 September|Topics|Pop and rock|David Bowie|features|Reuse this content|Most viewed|Most viewed|Fashion|Food|Recipes|Travel|Health & fitness|Women|Men|Love & sex|Beauty|Home & garden|Money|Cars|News|Opinion|Sport|Culture|Lifestyle|Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning|Sign up for our email|About us|Help|Complaints & corrections|SecureDrop|Work for us|Privacy policy|Cookie policy|Terms & conditions|Contact us|All topics|All writers|Modern Slavery Act|Digital newspaper archive|Facebook|YouTube|Instagram|LinkedIn|Twitter|Newsletters|Advertise with us|Guardian Labs|Search jobs|Patrons|Back to top|\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Then he returned to London but called me every day.|\"One day he told me his phone bill was so huge that I might as well fly over to him.|\"That's when it became different. He met me at the airport. Nothing was right.|\"My hair was a mess and I told him: 'I wanted to be beautiful for you.' He said: 'But you are.'\"|Marc bought a mansion in Richmond, Surrey, and they set up home together.|It was a long way from his roots as the son of Jewish tailor in Hackney, East London.|Growing up, despite money being scarce - his mother worked on a fruit stand in Soho - his parents had watched as their son made himself a makeshift guitar on which he tried to emulate his favourite icons, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochrane.|Later his musical destiny took shape as he hung around the famous 2 \"I\"s cafe in Old Compton Street where singers like Cliff Richard first came to fame.|By the time the family moved out to a prefab in Wimbledon, Marc's rebellious streak had resulted in his expulsion from school, he had channelled his flamboyant side into becoming a Mod, he'd had a stint modelling men's suits and swapped the \"k\" in Mark to a \"c\".|When Gloria moved in, Marc and June were not yet divorced, but he discussed marriage often with Gloria.|He told her how much he wanted children and virtually adopted her son as his own.|Rolan's birth in a Harley Street clinic made their happiness complete.|Then came the fateful night when disaster struck.|Scroll down for more...|Three-month-old Rolan with Marc and Gloria in 1976|After the last show in a music TV series Marc was hosting for Granada - where his close friend David Bowie was the final guest - Marc and Gloria went out for a meal at Morton's restaurant in Mayfair.|\"It had been a wonderfully romantic evening,\" Gloria told friends.|\"He asked me to sing for him, and I did Who Can I Turn To?

She was found lying on the bonnet and he, thrown from the car into the road, died instantly.|He had never learned to drive, always fearing he would die in a crash.|\"If he had been in a more robust car, like his Rolls-Royce,\" muses Rolan, \"he would almost certainly have survived.|\"But he'd lent the car to a friend, and given his driver the night off, so he and Gloria had to make do with the Mini.|\"There is no doubt that if they'd taken me with them that night, I would have been killed too - the seats were all crushed down into a tiny space.\"|Gloria lay in intensive care for some weeks, while Marc's parents looked after Rolan at their home.|Finally, when the doctors declared Gloria fit enough to fly, she realised she had little choice but to return to her parents' small home in California.|\"I was in need of a sanctuary,\" she said. \"And they provided it. I had lost almost everything - the great love of my life, my career [her vocal cords were wrecked by the accident], my looks, my financial security and my home.|\"But I still had Rolan - I didn't let him out of my sight for 18 years.\"|Says Rolan: \"When I was born, my father had slowed down his lifestyle because he took his responsibilities as a parent very seriously.|\"His career was not going as brilliantly as it had been, because punk was taking over, but there were still plenty of royalties coming in.|\"He wanted to provide for our future, but he found he was paying tax at 83per cent so he set up an offshore trust in the Bahamas.|\"Unfortunately, he hadn't had time to sort out all the details before he died, so there was no provision for us, and the trustees told us their hands were tied.|There was an added complication in that my father was still married to June. [She died in 1994.]|\"My mother went from a millionaire lifestyle to virtual poverty, and I often went without.|\"But even if we had money, it could never have made up for Dad not being there.|\"I don't remember being upset, but Mum tells me I often cried for him.\"|Learning that Gloria and Rolan were almost destitute, David Bowie came to the rescue.|Quietly, Bowie arranged to pay for Rolan's education in LA and settled other expenses as he was growing up. Bowie has never spoken of this.|\"The money allowed me to go to a good private school and meet children of celebrities.|\"They knew I didn't have any money, they always took me to one side and said: 'Keep your character. Stay who you are.'|\"So that has helped with motivation. For my mum, what mattered was love and the fact she was able to raise me.|\"She didn't want to go back to England and scream about the cash.\"|It was some years before it dawned on Rolan just how big a rock idol his father had been.|Since the age of six he would spend hours playing one of his father's songs, Born To Boogie, on a tiny portable record player.|It was one of the few reminders of his father - that, a gold disc and an autographed tambourine.|In 1997 he went to a screening of Marc Bolan's film, Born To Boogie, directed by Ringo Starr which showed two T.Rex concerts at Wembley Arena.|\"I had never seen him on stage before that and I had never appreciated his magnetism.|\"The film changed all that - I was blown away seeing him on screen and realising how powerful he was.|\"It was very emotional for me, of course, because I'm thinking: 'Hey, that's my dad up there.'\"|He graduated from university in LA with a degree in fine arts. Determined not to cash in on his own name, he had registered in his father's real surname, Feld.|He took a series of menial jobs, including working in a jewellery store for \u00a33 an hour.|But at the other end of the pay scale he has also modelled for Tommy Hilfiger.|Neither he nor Gloria have much in the way of mementos of Marc because after his death, there was a series of burglaries at their house.|Apart from the theft of dozens of unreleased recordings and unpublished compositions, almost all his glam rock props were taken - the latter only to emerge on eBay in the past few years.|\"I don't feel inclined to follow up the auctions in the hope of getting some of Dad's belongings back.|\"I don't have the stomach for a fight. I've had enough hassle over the estate as it is.\"|He is understandably relieved that the legal wrangles have been ironed out and that Marc's legacy is now coming through.|There is no suggestion of course that the trustees of Marc's affairs - Wizard (Bahamas) - have acted with anything less than strict regard for the legal rules.|It is only thanks to the determined efforts of Marc's record producer, Tony Visconti, that the way has finally been cleared.|He explains: \"Gloria and Marc never married, there was still a legal wife - June - in the background and Rolan suffered from archaic laws which don't allow an illegitimate child to inherit as of right.|\"The Estate of Marc Bolan stopped Rolan getting any regular payments. They were also holding up my own royalties as producer.|\"I successfully sued and it opened the gates for Rolan, because I got through. The Bolan fortune was quite a huge sum.\"|After a lengthy battle, the Trust has now arranged that Gloria and Rolan, who lives with his stepbrother, Walter Therman, can have a house from the investments in LA and that he will be given a \"controlled\" yearly allowance from the trust fund.|Marc's funeral was a hugely emotional affair, with thousands of fans sobbing as his coffin - topped by a huge floral white swan - was carried into the crematorium at Golders Green.|The tree on Barnes Common where the car crashed is a shrine permanently decked with flowers.|To commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, and his 60th birthday, there are TV documentaries, a double CD package called T.Rex - Greatest Hits and an exhibition of Bolan photos at London's Redfern Gallery.|On September 30, which would have been Marc's 60th birthday, there is to be a gala cabaret night, Bolan's Birthday Boogie, at London's Cafe de Paris which will feature a soundscape of his hits and evocative songs.|The evening will include the world premiere of A Fantasia Bolanesque, starring guest artists, including Boy George.|Rolan and Gloria Jones, and Marc's brother Harry Feld - a taxi driver - have been invited as guests of honour.|Gloria now helps run a children's orphanage in one of the poorest areas of Sierra Leone, West Africa, where she is also building the Marc Bolan School Of Music.|\"I want this time to be a celebration,\" she insists.|\"It is sad he is not here to see for himself how his music has lived on, but he was a happy person so everyone should be happy for him.|\"It is ironic that he is probably even bigger now than he was in his heyday.\"|She says she still finds it difficult to talk about the car crash.|\"I didn't come out of shock for 14 years. Marc was my soul-mate and we believed we had a great future together, which makes his death all the harder to bear.|\"There was the rock 'n' roll side to Marc, but really he was a quiet, humble boy.|\"I never saw the addictive side of him. Once Rolan was born he became a hands-on dad, and was very proud of him.\"|Says Rolan now: \"I've never tried to be like my father. Lately, I have been creating my own identity and impressing on people that they can be a fan of my father and still enjoy my music.|\"So I think any pressure I felt being 'son of Marc Bolan' has kind of gone away.\"|But after all the grief he has felt, he doesn't complain.|\"There are many times when I feel him around. Once I dreamed I was backstage at one of his shows and we talked as if we were really good friends but he didn't know I was his son.|\"Then I was in the audience and he pointed at me and he knew me. I woke up really happy.|\"Now, I go into a recording studio and I instinctively feel his spirit encouraging me, advising me.|\"If there is a problem in my life, I wonder what Dad would have done and I feel the answer coming into my head.|\"It's not as good as having him around in the flesh, but it is the next best thing.\"|Register for free to continue reading|Sign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events.|ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT?|LOG IN|Email|Please enter a valid email|Please enter a valid email|First name|Please enter a valid email|Please|Last name|2005|2004|2003|2002|2001|2000|1999|1998|1997|1996|1995|1994|1993|1992|1991|1990|1989|1988|1987|1986|1985|1984|1983|1982|1981|1980|1979|1978|1977|1976|1975|1974|1973|1972|1971|1970|1969|1968|1967|1966|1965|1964|1963|1962|1961|1960|1959|1958|1957|1956|1955|1954|1953|1952|1951|1950|1949|1948|1947|1946|1945|1944|1943|1942|1941|1940|1939|1938|1937|1936|1935|1934|1933|1932|1931|1930|1929|1928|1927|1926|1925|1924|1923|1922|1921|1920|1919|1918|1917|1916|1915|Year of birth|You must be at least 18 years old to create an account|Enter your password|Must be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number|I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.

          "|Speaking to The Independent on Sunday this weekend, Ms Aram described how she was driving just seconds behind Bolan on the ill-fated night: \"As I came over the bridge with Richard [Jones] beside me, I can still in my mind see, so clearly, a purple car which looked like a little beetle. It was upright and it was smoking and there was a tiny glimmer of light from the moon, the night was so still.\"|The \"little beetle\" was the Mini driven by Gloria Jones. Ms Aram said she didn't immediately stop at the car but drove a few metres past it.|\"I said 'we've got to get them out, this car might blow up'. I took my mother's rug from the back of my car and put it on the ground. Some of the fans are comforted by the fact he was laid on a nice lady's rug. I don't think Richard thought Marc was dead, but I knew he was. Gloria was groaning and almost conscious. But Richard cried and said 'please don't leave me'.\" In an eerie parallel with Bolan's death, Ms Aram said she crashed into a tree on the way to give evidence at Bolan's inquest a month later.|At the height of his fame in the early to mid-1970s, Bolan \u2013 born Mark Feld \u2013 outsold Jimi Hendrix and The Who with his band T Rex. But his good looks, catchy songs, air of mystique and untimely death at the age of 29 meant interest in the star has never waned.|Fee Warner, founder of the T Rex Action Group, bought the land where the sycamore tree stands to stop it from being felled. She and volunteers preserve the shrine dedicated to Bolan. Ms Warner, 53, said: \"A lot of people don't realise there was a fence between the tree and the road, because the fence was removed. When we came to build some steps, we found that when they had taken the fences away, they had taken away the ones that were undamaged, but the damaged ones had become buried on the site. That explains something which I have never been able to understand: why the damage to the tree is far higher than anything a Mini could have done.\"|Join our commenting forum|Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies|Comments|1|/|1|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|On the 35th anniversary of the glam rock star's death in a car accident, an eyewitness reveals what happened|\u2715|Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article|Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Rex, Marc Bolan was tragically killed, like so many rock stars, far too young, in a car accident in London in 1977.|Despite his influence on the pop cultural landscape of the 1970s,|the site of Bolan's death|was never officially recognized with a memorial. However, thanks to the musician's devoted fans, a shrine has been erected that continues to grow to this day.|Advertisement|The tribute to the musician began when lovers of Bolan's music began making pilgrimages to the site where the car in which he was a passenger collided with a tree. Visitors began hanging notes and trinkets from the sycamore tree the car had hit, which eventually spread to a posting board next to it. After years of devotional offerings being placed on the \"Bolan Tree,\" the branches started to give under the weight of the love hanging from its limbs, and the tree began to die.|Since the site was never officially recognized or cared for, no one knew what to do to save the tree, until a group of ultra-devoted fans formed the awesomely named \"T. Rex Action Group.\" TAG, as it came to be known, began caring for the spot and was eventually given ownership of the land in perpetuity. The group continues to look after and improve the site to this day.|Today a stone plaque has been added in addition to a bronze bust of the flamboyant performer. Bolan's musical influence continues to live, and new fans are born every day, assuring that the site of his death will continue to accumulate devotionals for another four decades.",

          "|]|Plaque marking Bolan's childhood home, 25|Stoke Newington|Common,|Hackney|.|Bolan was born at|Hackney Hospital|and grew up at 25 Stoke Newington Common, in the borough of|Hackney|, east London, the son of Phyllis Winifred (n\u00e9e Atkins) and Simeon Feld, a lorry driver. His father was an|Ashkenazi Jew|of Russian and Polish ancestry, while his mother was of|English|descent.|[7]|[8]|Moving to|Wimbledon|, southwest London, he fell in love with the rock and roll of|Gene Vincent|,|Eddie Cochran|,|Arthur Crudup|and|Chuck Berry|and hung around coffee bars such as|the 2i's|in|Soho|.|[9]|Bolan was a pupil at Northwold Primary School, Upper Clapton. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a|skiffle|band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\", a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old|Helen Shapiro|. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.|[10]|He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show|Orlando|, dressed as a|mod|. Bolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows.|Town|magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. When asked about his sexuality during an interview in 1975, Bolan said that he was bisexual.|[11]|Music career|[|edit|]|1964\u20131967: Early career|[|edit|]|In 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero,|Cliff Richard|, the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.|Bolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor|Allan Warren|, who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then \n-current source of inspiration,|Bob Dylan|. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.|[12]|Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"|Blowin' in the Wind|\" and|Dion|'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of|Betty Everett|'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.|Warren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul|David Kirch|, in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.|[13]|[14]|[15]|The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.|He signed to|Decca Records|in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from|James Bolam|, that it was a contraction of Bob Dylan, and \u2013 according to Bolan himself \u2013 that Decca Records chose the name.|[16]|He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with|the Ladybirds|on backing vocals (later finding fame with|Benny Hill|), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured|Jimmy Page|and|Big Jim Sullivan|, was produced by Jim Economides, with music director|Mike Leander|. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and|Donovan|. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In\", written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary|Fred Neil|, was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the|beat poets|. Neither song made the charts.|[9]|In 1966, Bolan turned up at|Simon Napier-Bell|'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album|The Beginning of Doves|). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death\", was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album|You Scare Me to Death|. Napier-Bell managed|the Yardbirds|and|John's Children|and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"|Desdemona|\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".|His tenure with the band was brief. Following an ill-fated German tour with|the Who|, Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (|The Krakenmist|and|Pictures Of Purple People|) as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth \u2013 he famously claimed to have spent time with a|wizard|in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that appeared on his first albums with|T. Rex|.|[9]|1967\u20131970: Tyrannosaurus Rex|[|edit|]|Bolan left John's Children when, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label|Track Records|. Unperturbed, he rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer|Steve Peregrin Took|and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in|Melody Maker|to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"|[9]|Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a|psychedelic|-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because Track Records had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"|[9]|The original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex with Took released three albums; two reached the top fifteen in the UK Albums Chart. They also had a top 40 hit \"Debora\" in 1968. They were supported with airplay by|BBC Radio 1|DJ|John Peel|.|[17]|One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free|Hyde Park concert|in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969\u201370 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.|[18]|It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.|[19]|In keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white|Fender|Stratocaster|decorated with a|paisley|teardrop motif from|Syd Barrett|. After replacing Took with|Mickey Finn|, he let the electric influences come forward even further on|A Beard of Stars|, the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by|Jimi Hendrix|.|[9]|1971\u20131975: T. Rex, glam rock and other styles|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan, the pixie prince of|glam rock|, remains a huge influence in music and fashion.|\u2014|Adam Sweeting|,|The Telegraph|.|[20]|Becoming more adventurous musically, Bolan bought a modified vintage|Gibson Les Paul|guitar (featured on the cover of the album|T. Rex|), and then wrote and recorded his first hit \"|Ride a White Swan|\", which was dominated by a rolling hand-clapping back-beat, Bolan's electric guitar and Finn's percussion. At this time he also shortened the group's name to T. Rex.|[9]|Bolan and his producer|Tony Visconti|oversaw the session for \"Ride a White Swan\", the single that changed Bolan's career which was inspired in part by|Mungo Jerry|'s success with \"|In the Summertime|\", moving Bolan away from predominantly acoustic numbers to a more electric sound.|[21]|Recorded on 1 July 1970 and released later that year, it made slow progress in the|UK Top 40|, until it finally peaked in early 1971 at number two.|[22]|Inspired by his muse, June Child, Bolan developed a fascination with women's clothing, an unlikely characteristic for a British male rocker at the time.|[23]|Bolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and|T. Rex|by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist|Steve Currie|and drummer|Bill Legend|, and cutting a five-minute single, \"|Hot Love|\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"|Hey Jude|\". Bolan performed \"Hot Love\" on the BBC television show|Top of the Pops|wearing glitter on his face: the performance was later recognized as the foundation of glam rock.|[3]|[24]|For the viewers, it was a defining moment: \"Bolan was magical, but also sexually heightened and|androgynous|\".|[3]|The song was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"|Get It On|\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song, re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the US, reached No. 10 in the|Billboard|Hot 100|in early 1972.|[3]|Dressed in a satin sailor suit, but also \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 with the glittery gold teardrops beneath his eyes. This performance is often acknowledged as the birth of glam. His androgynous style has been an enduring influence on fashion. From Gucci to Saint Laurent, fashion has long drawn inspiration from his style. He knew how to subvert gender norms into fantastical new shapes.|\u2014|Joobin Bekhrad,|The Guardian|, on Bolan's March 1971 appearance on|Top of the Pops|.|[24]|In November 1971, the band's record label,|Fly|, released the|Electric Warrior|track \"|Jeepster|\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for|EMI|, who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK.|In 1972, he achieved two more UK number ones with \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" taken from|The Slider|,  and two number twos in \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\".|[22]|In the same year he appeared in|Born to Boogie|, a documentary by|Ringo Starr|about T. Rex including a concert filmed at London's|Wembley Empire Pool|in March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at|John Lennon|'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and|Elton John|on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit. No T. Rex record was certified until 1985, as the record company has to pay for it, which Bolan's did not in the '70s.|[22]|Bolan took to wearing top hats and feather boas on stage as well as putting drops of glitter on each of his|cheekbones|. Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this \u2013 some say it was introduced by his|personal assistant|, Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on|Radio 1|that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then.  Other performers \u2013 and their fans \u2013 soon took up variations on the idea.|An outfit of Marc Bolan's on display at the|Hard Rock Cafe|in Sydney, Australia|The glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend|David Bowie|, whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which continued throughout his career. Bowie's 1972 song \"|All the Young Dudes|\"|name-checked|T. Rex.|[25]|Bowie's song \"|Lady Stardust|\" is generally interpreted as alluding to fellow glam rock icon Bolan. The original demo version was entitled \"He Was Alright (A Song for Marc)\"|[26]|In 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend|Jeff Lynne|on the|Electric Light Orchestra|songs \"|Ma-Ma-Ma Belle|\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from|On the Third Day|, as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.|[22]|For the following recording sessions, he recruited|soul|female singers for the backing vocals on \"|20th Century Boy|\", which peaked at number 3 in March, and mid-year \"The Groover\" which went to number four.|[22]|Tanx|, parts of which found him heading towards soul, funk and gospel, was both a commercial and critical success in several European countries. \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"|Teenage Dream|\" from the 1974 album|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend|Gloria Jones|on keyboards as well as backing vocals.|Eventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Jones, which began in July 1973. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums, putting|R & B|influences with rock on|Bolan's Zip Gun|. He was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working.|[9]|1976\u20131977: resurgence and final year|[|edit|]|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014|In September 1975 Gloria Jones gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from|tax exile|in the US and|Monaco|and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show|Supersonic|, directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, including \"New York City\" which reached the top 15. By then, Bolan was current with the music scene, incorporating disco elements in|Futuristic Dragon|and the single \"|Dreamy Lady|\". The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album,|Dandy in the Underworld|, and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along|punk|band|the Damned|as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday barely five years previously.|[9]|Later in 1977,|Granada Television|commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called|Marc|in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on|ITV|earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former|John's Children|\u2013bandmate|Andy Ellison|, then fronting the band|Radio Stars|.|[9]|Bolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival David Bowie was the final guest on the last episode of|Marc|. Bowie's solo song|\"Heroes\"|was the show's penultimate song; Bolan signed off, naming some of the musicians: \"All the cats; you know who they are\"; they then began to play a bluesy song, over the closing credits. After four words of Bowie's vocals, however, Bolan stumbled forward, and off the stage, but managed to grab the microphone, and find a smile. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.|[27]|Personal life|[|edit|]|Bolan began his first serious romantic relationship, with Teresa Whipman, in 1965.|[28]|They broke up in 1968 when Bolan met June Ellen Child. The pair immediately fell in love and moved into a flat together after only knowing each other for a few days.|[29]|They married on 30 January 1970.|[30]|She was a former secretary to his then managers,|Blackhill Enterprises|, also the managers of another of his heroes,|Syd Barrett|, whom June dated.|[31]|She was also influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.|[9]|Bolan's relationship with June was tumultuous; he engaged in several affairs over the course of their marriage, including one with singer|Marsha Hunt|in 1969, and another with artist|Barbara Nessim|while recording in America in 1971.|[32]|[33]|The couple separated in 1973, after June found out about Bolan's affair with his backing singer|Gloria Jones|.|[34]|After Bolan's death, June revealed that she had  abortions during their marriage because she believed Bolan was not mature enough to be a father.|[35]|[36]|Bolan and Gloria Jones were in a committed romantic relationship from 1973 until he died in September 1977.|[37]|The couple had a son together in September 1975 and the three of them lived together as a|nuclear family|for nearly two years until Bolan's death. At the end of June 1976, June Bolan sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery, citing Gloria Jones as the third party. At the court hearing on 5 October 1976, Deputy Judge Donald Ellison declared: \"I am satisfied that the husband committed adultery with the co-respondent, and that the wife finds it intolerable to live with him\", and granted a decree nisi. Twelve months after that date, it was to become a decree absolute thus severing the Bolans' matrimonial ties. \"The facts are that she initially left me, and we just grew apart,\" Bolan explained after the ruling. \"There were no great scenes, no smashing things up. It just suddenly happened one day. We weren't a couple anymore.\" He also used the opportunity to shed a little light on his sexuality. \"Anyway, I'm gay,\" he only half-jested. \"I can't say I was a latent homosexual \u2013 I was an early one. But sex was never a great problem. I'm a great screwer\". Asked about the institution of marriage, he replied: \"Gloria doesn't want to get married and neither do I. If I ever marry anyone again, I'll put in a clause that when it ends you're on your own \u2013 and that means financially, too.\"|[38]|Death|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|at the site where he died in a car crash in|Barnes, London|on 16 September 1977, two weeks shy of what would have been his 30th birthday.|Bolan never learnt to drive, fearing a premature death.|[39]|[40]|Despite this fear, cars or automotive components are at least mentioned in, if not the subject of, many of his songs. He also owned a number of vehicles, including a white 1960s|Rolls-Royce|that was loaned by his management to the band|Hawkwind|on the night of his death.|[41]|[42]|On 16 September 1977, Bolan was a passenger in a|Mini 1275GT|driven by Gloria Jones as they headed home from Mortons club and restaurant in|Berkeley Square|. Both had been drinking wine, and after she crossed a small|humpback bridge|near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, the car struck a fence post|[43]|and then a tree.|[44]|[45]|Bolan was killed instantly, while Jones suffered a broken arm and broken jaw.|[43]|[45]|The car crash site has become a shrine to his memory, where fans leave tributes beside the tree. In 2013, the shrine was featured on the|BBC Four|series|Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places|.|[46]|The site,|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|, is owned and maintained by the T. Rex Action Group.|[47]|Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Crematorium|Memorial plaque to Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium|His funeral service was held on 20 September 1977 at the|Golders Green Crematorium|in|North London|, where his ashes were later buried under a rose bush. At Bolan's funeral, attended by David Bowie,|Rod Stewart|,|Tony Visconti|and|Steve Harley|,|[48]|a swan-shaped floral tribute was displayed outside the service in recognition of his breakthrough hit single \"|Ride a White Swan|\".|There are two plaques dedicated to his memory at the Crematorium. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on\u00a0\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.|Bolan had arranged a discretionary|trust|to safeguard his money. A small, separate|Jersey|-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330\u00a0million (approx $38\u00a0\u2013 $57\u00a0million), remains in trust.|[49]|Legacy|[|edit|]|The T. Rex singer captivated generations with his strutting music and hyper-sexual charisma.|\u2014|Alexis Petridis|in|The Guardian|on \"glam's greatest icon\".|[3]|Bolan strongly influenced artists of many genres, including glam rock,|punk|,|post-punk|,|new wave|,|indie rock|,|Britpop|and|alternative rock|. After seeing Bolan wearing|Zandra Rhodes|-designed outfits,|Freddie Mercury|enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next|Queen|tour in 1974.|[50]|Bolan was the early guitar idol of|Johnny Marr|, who later found fame as the guitarist of the influential|indie rock|band|the Smiths|.|[51]|In 1979,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to the single \"|The Staircase (Mystery)|\". The band had played the song live for several months and on the first anniversary of Bolan's death in 1978 played the song as the encore when they performed at Aylesbury Friars. Emerging in the|New Romantic|movement in the early 1980s,|Boy George|spoke of the impact Bolan and Bowie had on him: \"They represented a kind of bohemian existence that I \u2013 at that point \u2013 could only imagine living. I loved the music. The first time I ever saw Marc Bolan really, properly was singing 'Metal Guru' and just loved him. I don't think you can separate an artist from what they wear or what they sing \u2013 it's kind of the complete package.\"|[52]|In December 1980, \"Telegram Sam\" was the fourth single released by British gothic rock band|Bauhaus|. Also in 1980,|the Bongos|were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the|Billboard|charts with a T.Rex cover. Since then, Bongos frontman|Richard Barone|has recorded several other Bolan compositions (\"The Visit,\" \"Ballrooms of Mars\"), worked with T.Rex producer|Tony Visconti|for his current solo album,|Glow|(2010,|Bar/None Records|) that includes a remake of Bolan's \"Girl\" from|Electric Warrior|, and has himself produced tracks for Bolan's son Rolan. In 1983,|NWOBHM|band|Girlschool|covered \"20th Century Boy\" on their|Play Dirty|. In 1984,|the Replacements|released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as a B-side to the single \"|I Will Dare|\"; it is also included on the reissue version of their album|Let It Be|.|[53]|In 1985,|Duran Duran|splinter band|Power Station|, with|Robert Palmer|as vocalist, took a version of \"Get It On\" into the UK Top 40 and to US No. 6, the first cover of a Bolan song to enter the charts since his death. They also performed the tune (with|Michael Des Barres|replacing Palmer) at the|Live Aid|concert. In 1986,|Violent Femmes|covered the song \"Children of the Revolution\" on their album,|The Blind Leading the Naked|.|[54]|In 1989,|X|released a live cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to their single \"|Kurenai|\". In 1990,|Baby Ford|did a cover of \"Children of the Revolution\" that appeared on the album|Oooh, The World of Baby For|. In 1991, Japanese rock band|T-Bolan|were named after T. Rex and Bolan.|[55]|\"It felt like he actually cast a spell. I've no doubt every aspect of how he presented himself was just an outpouring of his understanding that things could be magical, things could be heightened. Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us.\"|\u2014|U2|guitarist|The Edge|on Bolan after watching him on|Top of the Pops|in March 1971.|[3]|\"|20th Century Boy|\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a|Levi's|jeans TV commercial featuring|Brad Pitt|,|[56]|and was re-released, reaching No. 13 in the UK.|[57]|The song was performed by the fictional band the Flaming Creatures (performed by|Placebo|, reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999|Brit Awards|) in the 1998 film|Velvet Goldmine|. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including|Morrissey|. In 1991, Morrissey and|David Bowie|performed a duet of \"Cosmic Dancer\" at the|Inglewood Forum|in Los Angeles.|[58]|In 1993,|Guns N' Roses|covered \"Buick MacKane\" on|\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"|,|[59]|and their guitarist|Slash|has worn a t-shirt with an image of Bolan on the front.|[20]|The main riff of|Oasis|' 1994 hit \"|Cigarettes & Alcohol|\" is lifted from \"Get It On\". In 1993,|Adam Ant|covered the track live on his|Persuasion|tour.  The song was included on a private preview show on 21 February 1993 in Burbank, Los Angeles which was recorded and released, complete with the cover version, as a live bonus CD with 1994 pressings of his|Antmusic: The Very Best of Adam Ant|collection.|[60]|[61]|The Cameron Crowe-created movie|Almost Famous|features a scene where a Black Sabbath groupie is telling aspiring journalist William Miller (said to be created in Crowe's own image) about how, \"Marc Bolan broke her heart, man. It's famous,\" regarding the character of Penny Lane, played by|Kate Hudson|.|[62]|In 2000,|Naoki Urasawa|created a Japanese|manga|entitled|20th Century Boys|that was inspired by Marc Bolan's song, \"|20th Century Boy|\". The series is a multiple award-winner, and has also been released in North America. The story was adopted into three successful live-action movies from 2008 to 2009, which were also released in the US, Canada and the UK.|[63]|In 2003,|Depeche Mode|'s|Martin Gore|recorded covers of \"Life Is Strange\" and \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\", and included them as b-sides of the single \"Stardust\".|[64]|In 2006,|Def Leppard|released their album|Yeah!|, which contains covers of their favourite bands while growing up, the first song on this album is \"20th Century Boy\".|Joe Elliott|wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while|Vivian Campbell|wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". \"|Children of the Revolution|\" was performed by|Elton John|and|Pete Doherty|of|the Libertines|at|Live 8|, in 2005.|U2|'s|Bono|and|Gavin Friday|also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the|Moulin Rouge!|soundtrack|.|[65]|[66]|In 2020,|Kesha|would also record a cover of the song along with Marc Bolan's son,|Rolan|, on backing vocals.|[67]|His music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being|Breakfast on Pluto|,|Death Proof|,|Lords of Dogtown|,|Billy Elliot|,|Jarhead|,|Moulin Rouge!|,|Herbie: Fully Loaded|,|Breaking-Up|,|Hot Fuzz|,|Click|,|School of Rock|,|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World|and|Dallas Buyers Club|.|[68]|Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence (|Joy Division|/|New Order|'s|Bernard Sumner|has said that the first single he owned was \"Ride a White Swan\".) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.|In 2007, the|English Tourist Board|included|Bolan's Rock Shrine|in their guide to Important Sites of Rock 'n Roll interest 'England Rocks'.|[69]|As reported in 2011, a school is planned in his honour, to be built in Sierra Leone: The Marc Bolan School of Music and Film.|[70]|A musical,|20th Century Boy|, based on Bolan's life, and featuring his music, premiered at the|New Wolsey Theatre|in|Ipswich|in 2011.|[71]|In September 2020 a tribute album produced by|Hal Willner|,|Angelheaded Hipster|, was released featuring covers of Bolan songs by a variety of artists including|Nick Cave|,|U2|,|Elton John|,|Joan Jett|,|Nena|and|Todd Rundgren|.|[72]|Two months later, Bolan and T.

          "|Willner assembled the album because he felt Bolan was an overlooked figure: he noted that he \u201cwas hardly ever talked about as a composer\u201d, the conversation more often turning to \u201chow David Bowie took his essence and Bolan was in his shadow\u201d. That is certainly true in the US, where Get It on was T Rex\u2019s solitary hit, but the degree of enthusiasm the artists involved have for Bolan\u2019s work is enough to startle even a diehard T Rex obsessive like me.|Kesha was born a decade after|Bolan\u2019s death in 1977 in a car crash|and first heard T Rex in the early 00s. \u201cI just remember thinking, whatever this music was, it was the soundtrack of my soul: it really helped me unleash things inside me. I feel like I was raised by T Rex, because I didn\u2019t have a dad, so male figures in my life were the ones I\u2019d read about or listen to.\u201d|\u2018I feel like I was raised by T Rex\u2019 ... Kesha.|Photograph: Dana Trippe|What continues to attract musicians to an artist whose imperial phase lasted barely two years? The music, obviously: the golden run of singles that begins with 1970\u2019s Ride a White Swan and ends with 1973\u2019s 20th Century Boy; the insouciant, sexually charged brilliance of the albums Electric Warrior and The Slider. The image: what the Edge calls \u201cthat transgressional thing of challenging stereotypes and being this ambiguous creature \u2026 that really did create a new kind of space\u201d. The sense that, while other artists ultimately sold more records or had longer careers, it is hard to think of anyone who has been better at actually|being a pop star|than Bolan, with his self-mythologising lyrics \u2013 \u201cI drive a Rolls-Royce / \u2019Cos it\u2019s good for my voice\u201d \u2013 his interviews filled with wild claims and outrageously entertaining lies, his looks, his charisma.|\u201cHe was the perfect pop star,\u201d says John. \u201cHis songs were great, his records rocked, he had attitude, he had performing skills, he looked fabulous, he dressed the part. At a time when I was still becoming|Elton John|, he was a great role model. I thought: \u2018This guy doesn\u2019t give a fuck, he\u2019s just being who he is and he\u2019s loving every single minute of it.\u2019 And that had a great effect on me.\u201d|\u2018Maybe he could be running a cult in Fiji\u2019 ... Devendra Banhart.|Photograph: Ernesto Notarantonio/Ipa/Rex/Shutterstock|For another of the album\u2019s contributors, the singer-songwriter|Devendra Banhart|, part of Bolan\u2019s appeal is \u201cthe idea of switching up your style without any real concern, because he was really going for it\u201d. By the time of his first minor flush of fame in the late 60s, the former Marc Feld had already been a teenage mod who appeared in Town magazine, boasting about how many ties he owned, and a Dylan-inspired folkie called Toby Tyler, before becoming Marc Bolan, the author of two Donovan-esque flop solo singles and the guitarist and second vocalist in the Who-esque troublemakers John\u2019s Children.|Then came Tyrannosaurus Rex, an acoustic duo featuring Bolan and the percussionist Steve Peregrin-Took, but with the former evidently calling all the shots. Perhaps noting that Bolan was less committed to flower power idealism than he was to becoming famous, some areas of London\u2019s hippie counterculture regarded him with a jaundiced eye (\u201cHe was a cocky little shit,\u201d complains one underground luminary in Jonathon Green\u2019s definitive oral history of the era, Days in the Life), but the music Tyrannosaurus Rex made was frequently extraordinary. For an acoustic duo with a penchant for whimsy, they seldom sounded laid back: their songs charge along chaotically, fuelled by riffs and an energy closer to early rock\u2019n\u2019roll than folk.|Watch Nick Cave sing T Rex\u2019s Cosmic Dancer for the new tribute album Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T Rex|\u201cI just thought: \u2018Where the fuck has this come from?\u2019\u201d remembers John. \u201cI suppose it was a little like the Incredible String Band, but they were folkies \u2013 Marc Bolan was something different. He was sitting there in a cloak covered in stars, writing songs that sounded like Chuck Berry, very simple songs.|What?|\u201d|Banhart says: \u201cThe first time I heard Tyrannosaurus Rex, I thought: \u2018I am home. I\u2019m just in love. These are the best lyrics, this is the most fun energy, this is what real punk is to me. The nakedness of it. Led Zeppelin can hide behind these bombastic, heavy, aggressive walls of sound in order to sing about Mordor, but Marc is just singing about this wild, fantastical, Tolkienish world with nothing but the exoticness of his character.|\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the rock\u2019n\u2019roll thing, songs about cars, celebrating the interior of his Mustang Ford: \u2018It\u2019s all put together with alligator leather.\u2019 It isn\u2019t really psychedelic, it\u2019s a very particular thing.\u201d|Team spirit ... with Mickey Finn, who joined Bolan\u2019s band in its Tyrannosaurus Rex guise, in 1971.|Photograph: Araldo di Crollalanza/Rex|Over four albums, and with the help of|the producer Tony Visconti|, Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s sound expanded, Bolan gradually cranking up his electric guitar. You can hear vague intimations of what was going to happen \u2013 on the 1969 single King of the Rumbling Spires and on A Beard of Stars, the first album Bolan recorded with the percussionist Mickey Finn replacing Peregrin-Took \u2013 but clearly no one expected Ride a White Swan, the first release under the snappier name T Rex: sharper, more streamlined, more poppy, every instrument drenched in the kind of slapback echo found on old rock\u2019n\u2019roll records. The lyrics still sounded hippyish, but if any record can claim to have announced the arrival of the 70s, it is Ride a White Swan. \u201cI heard John Peel play it and I thought: \u2018This is amazing,\u2019\u201d says John. \u201cIt sounded like something that had come down from a spaceship; it was so out-there.\u201d|Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us|The Edge|It eventually reached No 2. Bolan expanded T Rex\u2019s lineup, bringing in the drummer Bill Legend and the bassist Steve Currie, and overhauled his image at the behest of his manager\u2019s wife, Chelita Secunda \u2013 out with the hippy cloaks, in with girls\u2019 clothes, satin and makeup (\u201cHe wore makeup during the day,\u201d remembers John, \u201cwhich I\u2019d never seen a man do before \u2013 I thought that was so cool\u201d). He played on his looks, amped up the sexuality in his music \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m gonna SUCK you,\u201d he howled on Jeepster \u2013 and that was that for the next two years: four No 1 singles, three No 1 albums, a film directed by Ringo Starr, hysteria the press called T Rextasy. There was far more depth to his songs than he was given credit for at the time \u2013 as Banhart points out, between \u201cthe flashiness, the smart lines, the cool boasts\u201d, there was a curious darkness in his lyrics: \u201cAll schools are strange\u201d, \u201cI danced myself into the tomb\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I\u2019m like me\u201d. Perhaps people couldn\u2019t hear over the screaming.|\u2018An understanding that things could be magical\u2019 ... U2\u2019s the Edge.|Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty Images|\u201cIt felt like he actually cast a spell,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt every aspect of how he presented himself was just an outpouring of his understanding that things could be magical, things could be heightened. Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us.\u201d|And then it went wrong. His grip on the songwriting he had honed to a kind of minimalist perfection on 1972\u2019s Metal Guru \u2013 a single that sounds like one long chorus \u2013 faltered. Bolan was rattled by his failure to break the US. \u201cI think he was just too androgynous for a lot of folks here,\u201d suggests Joan Jett, another Angelheaded Hipster contributor, who says Bolan was her first teenage crush. \u201cRadio just went for the safer stuff. I know from being in the Runaways how everyone treated us, so I just know they would have had issues with a Marc Bolan type of guy.\u201d|Bolan with his partner Gloria Jones, a former Motown staff writer.|Photograph: Estate of Keith Morris/Redferns|He was|smart enough to call time on glam|with 1974\u2019s elegiac single Teenage Dream and sharp enough to spot that the next thing might be a kind of rock/soul hybrid some time before his longstanding frenemy David Bowie decamped to Philadelphia. But having had the right idea, he couldn\u2019t quite make it work.|Bowie\u2019s Young Americans|sounded like an effortless reinvention. For all the bona fides of his|new partner Gloria Jones|\u2013 a former staff writer at Motown \u2013 Bolan\u2019s brand of plastic soul often felt like hard going, overstuffed with ideas. The other members of T Rex left, one by one, leaving him to front a band of session musicians. Tony Visconti baled out after 1974\u2019s poorly received Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow, claiming Bolan would no longer listen to anyone but yes-men.|Occasionally, something sparked, as on 1975\u2019s brilliant Think Zinc, but the album it came from, Bolan\u2019s Zip Gun, failed to chart.|Still, a prevailing wind started blowing in his favour once more. He had a couple of strong hits, New York City and I Love to Boogie, curbed the excesses that had left him looking bloated and finally nailed the soul-inspired sound on his great 1976 album Futuristic Dragon. Moreover, the emerging punk scene was staffed by people who had grown up in front of Top of the Pops at the height of T Rextasy and taken notes: three chords, distorted guitars, killer singles, be outrageous. Under punk\u2019s scorched-earth policy, vast tranches of rock\u2019s past were dismissed: T Rex were not.|\u201cThere was incredible discipline in T Rex\u2019s work,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cElectric Warrior is full of what I would call rock\u2019n\u2019roll 45s, which is such a rare thing: using rock and blues and guitar, but not losing sight of making great, accessible songs that have hooks and ideas and groove. They were an amazing band from that point of view, and that\u2019s the thing that I think a lot of rock lost sight of, progressive rock and whatever \u2013 whatever it was, it was not sexy music. I think the T Rex discipline is what gave them the chance to survive.\u201d|The admiration was mutual. Most established artists mocked or dismissed punk, or simply looked on with detached bemusement. Bolan, however, jumped in feet first: it seemed to activate the wild enthusiasm that John remembers: \u201cHe was always encouraging, never belittling; being with him was like having a hundred B12 injections at once.\u201d|Happy family ... Bolan and the Ramones in London, 1976.|Photograph: Richard Young/Rex|Bolan was in the audience for the Ramones\u2019 first UK gig. He took the Damned on tour with him and peppered his kids\u2019 TV show, Marc, with appearances by punk bands. You could say the fact that he was now presenting a kids\u2019 TV show was evidence of how far his star had fallen, but Bolan was pretty magnificent on it,|mercilessly hamming it up for the cameras|. \u201cThis is a new group called Generation X. They have a lead singer called Billy Idol who\u2019s supposed to be as pretty as me,\u201d he murmurs, effetely sniffing a flower. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d|A week after recording that link,|Bolan was dead, aged 29|. The premature death of an artist inevitably conjures a lot of what-ifs. It is tempting to wonder what might have happened had Bolan lived to see the glitter-obsessed denizens of the Blitz club and the synth era; to hear the Smiths rewriting Metal Guru as Panic or Get It on recast as Oasis\u2019s Cigarettes and Alcohol; or to enjoy British glam finally gaining US commercial success by proxy thanks to heavy metal: Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Slash stole his image from Bolan\u2019s Slider-era top hat and curls look; Def Leppard\u2019s Joe Elliott claimed that Pour Some Sugar on Me was an attempt to mimic T Rex\u2019s lyrics.|And it is tempting to wonder what Bolan might have made of another pre-eminent musical genius who clearly listened to T Rex, which Prince made explicit when he released his 1991 Bolan homage, Cream. \u201cWhen I met Prince, I thought he was like Marc: ethereal, very androgynous,\u201d says John. \u201cIf you look at the two of them, they\u2019re very similar, the way they posed. I can imagine Prince singing Telegram Sam, I can imagine Marc singing Raspberry Beret.\u201d|Glitter and curls: Marc Bolan and the birth of glam rock style|Read more|The truth is that he would have probably taken it all as his due \u2013 whatever his flaws, being crippled by modesty wasn\u2019t among them \u2013 just as he would taken Angelheaded Hipster and the praise from younger artists. \u201cHis attitude has really informed the way I look at my life,\u201d says|Kesha|. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t know what to do, like how to feel or how to behave, I think of people like Marc Bolan and all of a sudden it becomes more fun.\u201d|\u201cWhat would he be doing if he were alive today?\u201d muses Banhart. \u201cHe could be what Elon Musk is.

We open with The Wizard, the solo debut single that began Bolan\u2019s myth-building \u2013 he claimed he had studied sorcery under the titular sorcerer in France; his manager,|Simon Napier-Bell|, unsportingly suggested that Bolan had just met a man who did conjuring tricks in a Paris nightclub. Then there are the fantastic, wild, freakbeat singles Bolan wrote for John\u2019s Children that underlined the impossibility of him ever functioning merely as a band\u2019s backing singer: his voice looms out of the mix, overpowering everything else, a bizarre, quavering bleat he had apparently designed to draw as much attention to himself as possible.|Listen to Alex Petridis\u2019s Marc Bolan playlist|Spotify|The playlist picks its way along Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s path from hippy oddity to proto-glam.

          "|Nineteen forty-seven also marked the birth of the semiconductor revolution. Bell Laboratory scientists William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain announced the invention of the Bipolar Junction Transistor. The discovery caused little commotion at the time, but soon everyone would be carrying their own personal transistor radios. Three decades later, semiconductor manufacturers around the world would be spewing out millions of tiny microprocessors, each carrying well over a million transistors and capable of executing over one-hundred-million instructions per second.|In sports, Jackie Robinson became the first black man to sign a contract \nwith a major baseball club and New York beat Brooklyn to win the 1947 \nWorld Series.|Britain had just come through its most severe winter since 1894. But the cold of winter was quickly forgotten as the country prepared itself for a royal wedding between the heir to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, and Philip Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh.|And in the East London suburb of Hackney, a working-class Jewish couple, Simeon and Phyllis Feld, were expecting a child. Phyllis worked days at a fruit stand in Soho while Simeon worked at various odd jobs including cosmetic salesman and truck driver. On September 30th, 1947, the couple gave birth at Hackney General Hospital to a son and they named him Mark.|As far as Mark was concerned, he was born a star. \"When I was younger\", he recalled, \"I certainly thought I was a superior kind of being. And I didn't feel related to other human beings.\" Mark's parents remember him as a very strong willed boy who would kick anyone he didn't like. He had his share of fights during his school years and was a member of a local gang known as the Sharks. On one occasion, Mark claimed to have been knifed during a fight with a rival gang.|Mark had a strong imagination and would often make believe that he was Audie Murphy, Mighty Joe Young, or the Phantom of the Opera. He was also an avid movie fan. He most enjoyed science fiction and horror films and could name every title, actor, producer, and director.|Mark gained an appreciation for music at an early age spending hours listening to his parent's record collection. His favorite was a song about an American frontiersman from Tennessee, a place far away and much different than the London Mark grew up in. The song was \"The Ballad of Davey Crockett\" by an American songwriter named Bill Hayes. Mark's father, eager to encourage his son's interest in music, went out shopping one day to buy another record by his son's favorite musician, but he made an innocent mistake that would change the course of Mark's life forever. Instead of buying another record by Bill Hayes, Simeon confused the name with another American. The artist was Bill Haley and the song was \"Rock Around The Clock\". At age eight, Mark Feld had been handed his calling.|The Young Mark Feld|It didn't take long for Mark to act on his love for music. He first built himself a makeshift guitar which he used to learn the basics. He then talked his indulgent parents into buying him a drum kit. Later, when he was nine they bought him a guitar for 16 pounds which was nearly a month of Simeon's salary.|His mother would later recall how Mark would go to see someone like Cliff Richard in concert and come home saying \"that's how I'll be one day.\" Among his earliest compatriots were Keith Reid, future lyricist for Procul Harum, Cat Stevens, and a young man whose life would often be intertwined with his own, David Bowie.|Mark began to build a record collection with money he made doing odd jobs which included serving espresso behind the counter at the legendary 2 I's on Old Compton Street. The 2 I's served as a launching pad for many famous British acts including a young man named Harry Webb who would later change his name to Cliff Richard. Mark himself auditioned there, supposedly on the same day as did Harry Webb, but was turned down.|At age 12 Mark joined a 3 piece band called Susie and The Hula Hoops as a tea-chest bass player. The band's lead vocalist was named Helen Shapiro. Helen would eventually leave the band and within months record a string of pop-hit singles including two number 1 hits in Britain. Although Mark would deny that it had any impact on him, many believed that her success spurred him on to pursue his own path to stardom. He dropped out of school, having already been expelled, and went in search of an opportunity in acting.|During this time Mark befriended the girls from a British TV show called \"Oh Boy\". The girls would take Mark to all of their performances at the Hackney Empire. It was there that Mark had one of his first face-to-face meetings with a contemporary rock star.|Rock and Roll had been born in the USA and was being exported to\nEurope by a handful of early American rock stars who's popularity\noverseas nearly dwarfed their popularity back home in the States. One\nof these stars was Eddie Cochran and it was he who happened to be at the Hackney Empire on this night for his first Brittish tour.|Eddie Cochran|As the story goes, following Eddie Cochran's performance at the Hackney Empire, Cochran handed his guitar to the then 13 year old starry eyed Mark Feld who proceeded to carry the guitar to Cochran's waiting limousine. It was a moment that Mark was always proud to relate and one that would often be singled out as an important event in Mark's life, as if that event - the act of having touched Eddie Cochran's guitar, had some greater, almost mystical, significance.|This story, unfortunately, has a tragic and perhaps eerily ironic ending. At the end of Cochran's tour of England, the taxi carrying Cochran, his girlfriend Sharon Sheely, and fellow American Rock Star Gene Vincent, blew a tire while on its way to the London Airport. The car swerved off the road and slammed into a lamp post. Several hours later, on April 17th, 1960, Eddie Cochran joined his good friend Buddy Holly on the list of early rockers who gained instant immortality through a tragic death.|At age 13 Mark spotted a man walking down the street in front of his house wearing clothes which would become typical of the Mod movement in Britain. The sight so impressed Mark that he began spending all of his money on similar clothes. Later, commenting on this period of his life, Mark would say that he had an obsession with clothes, owning forty suits and often changing them 4 or 5 times a day. \"I used to go home and literally pray to become a Mod,\" he would remember.|Bumping into Angus McGill one day, a writer for the Evening Standard, Mark bragged about all of the clothes he owned. McGill followed Mark home to see his collection of clothes. Impressed with what he saw, McGill recruited Mark for a feature article about the Mod scene in Town magazine, a forerunner of modern men's magazines such as GQ. The article was entitled 'Faces Without Shadows' and was written by a fellow named Peter Barnsley. It included some of the earliest photographs of Mark to ever appear in print. They were taken by Don McCullin - Later to become a famous war photographer.|Beneath one of the pictures Barnsley included the following paragraph which included a rather ominous prediction:|Mark As Model|\"Feld is fifteen years old, and still at school. His family has just moved from Stamford Hill to a pre-fab out in Wimbledon. Of this he does not approve. The queues of Teds outside the cinemas in Wimbledon look just like a contest for the worst haircut, he says. At least the boys of Stamford hill dress sharply, and who would want a new, clean house if it is in unsympathetic surroundings? Nonetheless cleanliness is of vital importance to him. Shining with soap and health, he is apparently tireless and often goes for days on end without any sleep; there is never a trace of fatigue or boredom in his face.\n\"What is the point of all this energy and all the soap and water? Where is the goal towards which he is obviously running as fast as his impeccably shod feet can carry him? It is nowhere. He is running to stay in the same place and he knows by the time he has reached his mid-twenties the exhausting race will be over and he will have lost.\"|Following these events Mark was introduced to a modeling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\". As such he was used as a model for their suits in their catalogues as well as a model for cardboard cutouts to be displayed in their shop windows. Whether because they were unimpressed or because they wanted to keep their catalogue fresh with new faces is uncertain, but he was never used again.|Mark then shifted his focus back towards music and, at age 17, made another attempt to kick-start a career in the business. Sporting a denim cap and playing an acoustic guitar, he decided to try his hand at the British folk circuit. The sound resembled a Dylan/Donovan mix and, indeed, his songs consisted of some Dylan covers and a few other folksy tunes. To complete the new look and sound, Mark even came up with a new name for himself. Thus it was that the short music career of Toby Tyler began.|Mark as Toby Tyler|It didn't take long until Toby met up with an actor named Allan Warren\nwho offered to become his manager. Allan helped arrange recording time\nfor Toby and they proceeded to record several tunes including Dylan's\n\"Blowin' in the wind\". A version of Betty Everett's \"You're No Good\"\nwas submitted to EMI for a test screening but they turned Toby\ndown. Deciding that the future for Toby Tyler looked bleak, Warren and\nToby parted company after which Toby Tyler once again became simply\nMark Feld. (There was one small change however, but it's not clear to\nme when exactly it occurred. And that is that somewhere around this\ntime period, Mark chose to drop the \"k\" from his name and replace it with a\n\"c\". Therefore, many poems and diaries from this period were signed as\nMarc Feld rather than as Mark Feld.)|The tapes produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished from thought and mind for over twenty-five years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly eight-thousand dollars. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available the earliest of Marc's known recordings.|With yet another attempt to get into the music business at a dead end, Marc found himself hanging around the National Theatre looking for work. He was able to land several character parts in some TV shows including a delinquent on the Sam Kydd TV series and a show called 'Orlando'. But TV acting bored Marc so he decided to take an extended trip to France.|The accounts of what happened in France differ and not even Marc ever seemed to tell the same story twice. He was known to occasionally stretch the truth or fabricate pieces of it and seemed to often forget which parts were real and which were fantasies. He once admitted to an interviewer that he felt that his credibility as a poet allowed him to stretch the truth or make things up.|In any case, according to Marc's accounts he met a magician who lived\nin a 40 room mansion with libraries of books on mythology and black\nmagic. Marc claimed to have witnessed levitations, seances, and\ncrucifixions of live cats. He even claimed to have at one point\nwitnessed a ceremony at which the attendees resorted to consumption of\nhuman flesh. All of this, recall, was from Marc's own\naccounts. According to one of Marc's early producers, Simon\nNapier-Bell, however, Marc had merely met a guy who did magic tricks\nand spent a weekend with him.|Whatever the real truth, the experience had a profound effect on Marc. He left France with a much more highly developed imagination and a near obsession with Greek mythology, British romantic poetry, and the Tolkien books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of The Rings\". The Tolkien books had reached nearly Biblical status with the sixties generation of hippies and they would have a tremendous influence on Marc's early song writing; manifesting themselves in the form of enchanted poems and lyrics.|Marc returned to Britain more determined than ever to become a star. He locked himself away for months writing songs in a manic frenzy of inspiration. His future wife would later describe his writing style in terms of \"a force flowing out of him\". He himself contributed it to the work of his Guardian Angel whom, he was sure, really did all of the writing. During this period of time, Marc would churn out a reservoir of songs which he would still be tapping into five albums later. Among them was a song which he entitled \"The wizard\" in honor of his wizardly friend in France. With the help of producer Jim Economedies, he recorded the song and landed a record contract with Decca.|When Marc received the initial samples of \"The Wizard\" from Decca he\nreceived a mild shock. His name had been changed again; but this time\nwithout his approval. Decca had decided that the name Marc Feld would\nNOT do and had changed his last name to \"Bowland\". The name change\ndidn't bother Marc as much as did the fact that he had not been\nconsulted about the matter. As would become typical of other events in\nhis future, Marc refused to allow Decca to have it their way without\nhis stamp of approval. After negotiations, he convinced them to drop\nthe W and the D from Bowland to shorten the name to BOLAN. Thus, Marc\nFeld became Marc Bolan and in November of 1965 \"The Wizard\" was\nreleased and the voice and music of Marc Bolan was broadcast for the\nfirst time over British airwaves.|Mark Feld as Marc Bolan|Decca's press release on the Wizard single was a masterpiece of sixties hype. It read:|\"Marc Bolan was born in September 1947. After 15 years had passed he traveled to Paris and met a black magician called The Wizard, He lived for 18 months in The Wizard's chateau with Achimedies, an owl, and the biggest, whitest Siamese cat you ever saw. He then felt the need to spend some time alone so he made his way to woods, near Rome. For two weeks he strove to find himself and then he returned to London where he began to write. His writings mirror his experiences with mentionings of the magician's pact with the great god Pan. In London, walking down Kings Road, Chelsea in the dead of night, he chanced to meet a girl named Lo-og who gave him a magic cat. This cat, named after the girl, is now his constant companion and is a source of inspiration to him. Now The Wizard's tale is set down for all to hear on Marc's first recording for Decca.\"|A small poem accompanied two photographs of Bolan. It read:|\"Standing alone in the wood, with the golden palace bleeding scarlet tears into the sunset, I thought of all the treasures in the magic palace. And all the emptiness in my stomach and I smiled secretly, Rememberin' the wizard's words.\"|A critic for Disc Magazine reviewed the Wizard as follows:|\"On the strength of this strange young man's looks and weird background I suspect we'll hear more of this odd record about meeting a Wizard in the woods who knew all. I prefer the other side, 'Beyond the Risin' Sun' which has more tune. Jim Economedies, ace producer, does lovely things on this. I'm a bit put off by the way this boy sings with Dylan phrasing but that's all.\"|A record contract doesn't mean instant success and Marc found himself hustling for interviews and write-ups. One of his first interviews as Marc Bolan was with Angus McGill, the same writer who had interviewed Marc years earlier about the Mod trend. According to Angus he simply did not recognize the new Marc. \"I had remembered him as a rather plain little chap\", he said, \"and suddenly there was the most glamorous young man you'd ever seen, all curls and exotic clothes. He played the record, which I thought was appalling and showed me some poetry which struck me as unmitigated rubbish. I never thought he'd make it. But then I once predicted that TV would never catch on either.\"|Keith Altham, Marc's future publicist who at this point in time was just an acquaintance, remembers Marc frequenting a bar called the Brewmaster. He would come in carrying his record and say \"Gotta listen to this fellas, I'm going to be the greatest thing since Elvis Presley.\" \"Nice little bloke Marc!\", they all thought, \"Sit down and have a Coca Cola.\" No one really expected him to get too far.|Marc performed \"The Wizard\" on the TV show \"Ready, Steady, Go\". Unfortunately, the band missed out on the intro, played too fast, and in the wrong key. To make matters worse the show encountered technical problems and the signal went dead for most of Marc's debut. It was a disaster.|In June of 66 Decca released a follow up single called \"The Third Degree\" backed by what Marc called an unfinished demo titled \"San Francisco Poet\". It flopped. This single was to have been followed up by a song called \"Jasper C. Debussy\" but by then Marc's contract with Decca had expired and Marc had moved on to Columbia and producer Simon Napier-Bell.|Following his lack of success with Decca, Marc called producer Simon Napier-Bell and told him \"I'm a singer and I'm going to be the biggest rock star ever, so I need a good manager to make all the arrangements.\" Simon told him to send him his demo tapes but Marc insisted that he was close by and could just drop them in. Ten minutes later he arrived at Simon's office with his guitar around his neck and announced that he had no demo tapes after all but would be happy to sing a few tunes for him. He sat in a chair cross-legged, accentuating his short stature, and played all the songs on acoustic guitar - enough, according to Simon, to fill nearly four albums. By the end of the set, Simon was on the phone booking some time in a local recording studio.|Simon recalled that Marc was ridiculously egotistical at the time, to the point where it was easy to get furious with him. He actually thought that all he needed to do was to make a few posters of himself and things would just sort of happen. Simon disagreed and convinced Mark to add some strings to one of the songs, called \"hippy gumbo\", and approach some record companies with it.|Unfortunately, none of the record companies liked the tune. When Simon told Marc the news, he was completely shattered - not even expecting to be turned down. Eventually however, Simon was able to convince Columbia records to take Marc on and the single was released in June of '67. This single was another flop and was greeted with bad reviews including one that called the single, quote, \"a crazed mixture of an incredibly bad negro blues singer and Larry the Lamb.\"|Marc made a second appearance on \"Ready, Steady, Go\" to promote 'Hippy Gumbo'. This appearance went much better than his first but it was overshadowed by the first British TV appearance of Jimi Hendrix. Marc later boasted that Hendrix told him how much he liked his voice but that he would never make it. In some respects this prediction was true in as much as by mid 1967 the short solo career of Marc Bolan had failed to take root.|Simon Napier-Bell happened to be producing two other groups at this point in time. One was The Yardbirds, which included future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Watching the Yardbirds work was one of the things Marc would later recall as one of the highlights of this period. The other band was a group called John's Children who were signed to the Who's label, Track.|John's Children had previously been known as the Silence which had developed from a number of even earlier bands such as the Clockwork Onions and The Few. The name John's Children came about because bass player John Hewlett was the leader of the band. The other band members were lead singer Andy Ellison, guitarist Geoff McClelland, and drummer Chris Townsen who occasionally deputized for the Who's Keith Moon. The band had already caused quite a stir in England after having done some nude publicity shots and performing some relatively wild stage acts. Today they are remembered as one of the first psychedelic bands of this era.|John's children had already released two singles. One was called \"The Love I Thought I'd Found\" which was released in America retitled as \"Smashed!! Blocked!!\". The second single was called \"Not The Sort Of Girl You Take To Bed\" which flopped. Following these two singles guitarist Geoff McClelland was kicked out of the band, having failed to live up to the expectations of his fellow band members or the owner of the Track record label, Kit Lambert, who was also the Who's manager at the time.|In addition to the Who, Lambert had signed Jimi Hendrix and John's Children to his record label but insisted that Marc Bolan be included in the deal as John's Children's guitarist. The deal was acceptable to Simon-Napier Bell who, having failed to make Marc Bolan a solo success, saw a union between John's Children and Marc as a move that would potentially benefit both parties. John's children would have a better guitarist as well as one that could write music and Marc could broaden his exposure by joining up with a band that had already established a following. Marc found the deal acceptable if for no other reason than he would be recording on the same record label as Jimi Hendrix whom he had immense respect for.|Bolan Era John's Children|The merger was made and the new line up of John's Children headed for the recording studio to put down some new tracks. After one week they emerged with several demos and releasable songs. The first to be released was a Bolan compilation called Desdemona. Andy Ellison performed the lead vocals on the song but Bolan's unique voice was unmistakably present on the background vocals. The single was released in May of '67 and initially appeared to be headed for the top of the charts. Unfortunately, The BBC dealt the song a fatal blow by banning the song because it considered the line \"lift up your skirt and fly\" to be offensive. Despite this the song was popular and to this day is considered to be one of the finest British releases of 1967.|Onstage, John's children were as controversial as their music. Andy Ellison was prone to getting excessively wild, jumping around the stage, leaping into the crowd and occasionally attacking other members of the band. Marc would swing between moods sometimes simply sitting cross-legged on the stage and other times running around the stage in circles.|In their private lives, however, Marc was clearly apart from the others. Andy Ellison would later recall that the rest of the band was into drugs and dropping acid while Marc would only occasionally sip a little wine and spent most of his time simply writing songs. This, among other reasons, was why the merger of Bolan with John's children was to be a relatively short-lived union.|Marc also grew increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that John, not he, was choosing the musical direction of the band. Their second single with Marc was to have been \"Midsummer Nights Scene\" with \"Sarah Crazy Child\" on the flip side - both Bolan compositions. But, for reasons that are still unclear, the single was shelved at the last minute even though it had already been pressed. In its place was released a Hewlett/Townsen number called \"Come And Play With Me In The Garden\".|Then, perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back, a concert in Ludswigshaven, Germany while touring Europe with the Who, nearly ended in disaster. Near the end of their set the band jumped into a song entitled \"You're a Nothing\" which ended with a repeated German chant. Andy Ellison grew quite a bit more wild than usual and jumped off the stage with a large sack of feathers that he had pulled from hotel pillows. While he went about the business of tossing feathers at the crowd, Marc began beating at his amps with chains, and the rest of the band began chanting the German slogan. Eventually, a riot broke out. Fans began to rush the stage and the band just narrowly made an escape to the safety of their limousines. They drove off just as the police began moving in armored cars to quell the riot. The Who had to cancel their act that night and the German government confiscated a good deal of John's Children's equipment.|Marc left the band soon after - less than 6 months after joining it.|But he left John's Children with a mission - to establish his own rock band under his own complete control. Still wielding the electric guitars and amps he had used with John's children, Marc put ads in the International Times looking for other musicians. Not patient enough to wait, he also booked a gig at the Electric Garden in London's Covent Garden, a club that would later change its name to \"Middle Earth\" after the mythical land in the Tolkien trilogies.|An 18 year old drummer named Steve Turner responded to the add. Marc hired him but convinced him to change his name to Steve Peregrine Took after the youngest of the four hobbits in the Lord of The Rings trilogy. The name change was fine for Steve apparently as long as Marc didn't mind being referred to as Nalob Cram - Marc Bolan spelled backwards.|Steve Peregrine Took|In addition to bringing a full drumkit to the band, Steve Took could also acceptably integrate several other strange instruments into the music such as kazoos and pixiephones. He could also handle backing vocals quite well being able to immediately find a harmony for nearly anything Marc sang. According to Marc's soon to be producer Tony Visconti, Steve was perhaps the only person who was ever able to really get inside Marc's head and travel the distance into the Middle Earth landscape where most of his musical themes took place.|In addition to Steve, Marc recruited a 28 year old bearded guitarist named Ben who, according to Steve, kept turning green with stomach ulcers and a bass guitarist who was also a lot older than Marc and Steve and smoked a pipe which clearly labeled him as an undesirable - or at least so thought Steve. There was one other member of the band, but little is documented or remembered about him. In fact, the identities of all three of these original band members remains a mystery today.|Marc needed a name for this new band. Naturally he wanted a name that reflected his belief in mythology but knew that most people didn't adhere to such beliefs. But Marc reasoned that modern science had firmly proven the existence of the dinosaurs; creatures that, far more than anything else known to man, encroached on the boundaries of mythology. And if such creatures had existed millions of years ago, then who could argue against the possibility that even long before they existed there may have been creatures more like fire breathing dragons and other mythological creatures. Following this reasoning, Marc decided to name his band after a dinosaur. But not just any dinosaur would do. It had to be the biggest and baddest of them all - the king of the dinosaurs; the Tyrannosaurus Rex.|With a new band and a new name, Marc headed for the Covent Garden. Time didn't allow for such trivialities as rehearsing so the band practiced together only once before the show. The result was disastrous. The band members were simply incompatible and the total lack of rehearsal understandably didn't help. The band was promptly booed off the stage and disbanded almost immediately afterwards. To make matters worse, Track records, who owned most of what remained of John's Children's equipment following the German fiasco, repossessed Marc's electric guitar and amps. Then, to scrape up enough cash to obtain the bare necessities of life, Steve had to sell his drumkit and replaced it with a simple pair of bongos.|Thus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, which Marc had started with the best of\nintentions, had disintegrated into a 2 piece band owning only a set of\nbongos and an acoustic guitar. They may well have vanished from the\nmusic histories altogether had it not been for the support of a very\nearly ally and big fan - radio disk jockey|John Peel|.|Tyrannosaurus Rex|John had operated an illegal offshore radio station which was eventually shut down by the BBC. But being illegal allowed Peel to play lots of music NOT allowed or sanctioned by the BBC including underground bands like Tyrannosaurus Rex. After the offshore radio was shut down, Peel was hired by the Middle Earth club and immediately recruited the fledgling Tyrannosaurus Rex as a house band. Later, after landing a job at Radio One, John would often invite Tyrannosaurus Rex to play live on his show. Some of these recordings along with those from many other bands are currently available on a series of albums and CDs known as the Peel sessions. John also made sure that whenever he was asked to MC at clubs throughout England, Tyrannosaurus Rex was brought along as his warm-up band. Eventually, this exposure began to build a following for the band and they were soon being asked to play at various colleges and open air festivals around England. They even appeared at the first free Hyde Park festival in 1968.|Thus, with John Peel's help, Marc's Tyrannosaurus Rex survived the Winter of 1968. Aside from a few rough cuts released on an album years later called \"The Beginning of Doves\", little in the form of recordings is available of Tyrannosaurus Rex from those early days and, historically, it's fair to say that Tyrannosaurus Rex was dormant and would remain so until the thaw of spring.\n\n<!-- Play version of \"Beyond the Rising Sun\" on Doves. ->|[Home]|[Next Chapter]",

Photo credit: BBC|T-Rex fans will be delighted with the news that the British glam rockers will \u201cofficially\u201d be acknowledged as rock and roll legends being nominated along with Whitney Houston and Biggie Smalls aka Notorious B.I.G into the 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The significance in this historical moment musically speaking is how the main operator behind the band, Marc Bolan took the definition of what rock and roll is all about to another dimension with his musical range that remains to be impressive by today\u2019s standards.|According to\u00a0Gloria Jones, Bolan\u2019s then girlfriend, bandmate and mother of their son, Rolan Feld Bolan said to|Billboard|,|\u201cHe was a very humble spirit, but he understood who he was. He understood his worth.\u201d Nevertheless, Jones adds, the glam rock pioneer, \u201cwould have been very, very honored, and I\u2019m sure he would have been brought to tears. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very happy, and he\u2019s very honored.\u201d|Why Marc Bolan Remains To Be A Glam Rebelling Rock Icon \u2013 A Flamboyant Identity That Thwarts The Restraints of Society Standards|Marc Bolan was way ahead of his time in his short career as one of the top charting artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
          "|Much has been made of exactly how the glitter ended up on Bolan\u2019s cheeks. In a 1974 BBC interview, Bolan said: \u201cThere was some of my wife\u2019s glitter and I just spit on me fingers and stuck it under me eyes. I thought it looked cute \u2026\u201d|In one Bolan biography, his then wife, June Child, claimed the idea was hers. Numerous sources, however, cite Chelita Secunda, the wife of Bolan\u2019s manager at the time, as the woman behind the glitter. \u201cChelita was a muse to Marc Bolan,\u201d remarked artist Duggie Fields in Michael Bracewell\u2019s book Roxy: The Band That Invented an Era. \u201cIndeed, being the instigator of Marc\u2019s addiction to glitter and women\u2019s clothes, she can be held responsible for much of the look now referred to as glam rock.\u201d In Paul Trynka\u2019s biography, David Bowie: Starman, the DJ Jeff Dexter is quoted as saying that Chelita gave Bolan some glitter at her house, in the presence of Bowie and Elton John. \u201cShe wore glitter herself, and one day she put glitter on Marc. David was there and said, \u2018I want some\u2019, and [Elton] had some too. So the birth of glam rock was definitely at Chelita\u2019s.\u201d|In any case, rock and popular culture would never be the same. Far from being a mere twopenny prince in Persian gloves, as he described himself in Hot Love, Bolan had become the progenitor \u2013 and king \u2013 of glam. \u201cOh man, I need TV when I\u2019ve got T. Rex!\u201d Bowie would later exclaim in his song|All the Young Dudes|.|For the next couple years or so, \u201cT. Rextasy\u201d was all the rage in Britain. In his sparkly lam\u00e9 and plush, leopard-print blazers, feather boas, top hats and mary-jane shoes \u2013 not to mention generous helpings of mascara, eyeshadow and powder \u2013 Bolan belted out hit after catchy hit, looking exquisite.|Satin and tat: Bolan in London in the mid 70s.|Photograph: MARKA/Alamy|\u201cSatin suits and boas and the Anello and Davide mary janes were|his|look\u201d, says designer Anna Sui, who described Bolan as a \u201cperennial\u201d style inspiration. Biba\u2019s founder, Barbara Hulanicki, remembers a sequinned rainbow blazer of hers that Bolan wore in a number of photographs: \u201cHe was small. I have a feeling it came off the girls\u2019 floor. Oh, he looked so amazing in that jacket.\u201d|He also looked conspicuously androgynous for the era, a quality that the writer Simon Reynolds says was one of the things that defined Bolan. Before Bowie\u2019s sexually ambiguous incarnation as Ziggy Stardust or Brian Eno\u2019s colourful gender-bending in Roxy Music, Bolan had popularised an image and attitude untypical of British male rockers. \u201cI think [my use of glitter] caused a change \u2026 especially with cosmetics,\u201d Bolan said in the BBC interview \u201cGuys could go out on stage \u2026 being not|effeminate|, but not necessarily having to have Brut aftershave on \u2013 you know, super-masculine. You could use makeup and you could use [other such] things to brighten the act.\u201d|T. Rextasy was all too brief, as was Bolan\u2019s life, which ended in 1977, when girlfriend Gloria Jones crashed into a tree exactly two weeks before his 30th birthday. Like his music, the style he pioneered continues to influence. Alongside Gucci and Saint Laurent, labels such as Hedi Slimane\u2019s Celine and Halpern have at times drawn inspiration from Bolan\u2019s preference for chunky platforms, feather boas and snakeskin prints. See also The Temples frontman James Bagshaw (a dead ringer for Bolan) and Annie Clark (AKA St Vincent), in whom echoes of Bolan can sometimes be seen, as well as even the \u201csuper-masculine\u201d Slash \u2013 who for decades has mirrored Bolan\u2019s leather top hat-and-curly mop look on the cover of his 1972 album The Slider|.|As Bolan said of his glittery Top of the Pops performance: \u201cLook what happened to the world after that!\u201d|AngelHeaded Hipster|, a tribute album featuring Mark Almond, Elton John, Nick Cave and others, is due out on BMG on 4 September|Topics|Pop and rock|David Bowie|features|Reuse this content|Most viewed|Most viewed|Fashion|Food|Recipes|Travel|Health & fitness|Women|Men|Love & sex|Beauty|Home & garden|Money|Cars|News|Opinion|Sport|Culture|Lifestyle|Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning|Sign up for our email|About us|Help|Complaints & corrections|SecureDrop|Work for us|Privacy policy|Cookie policy|Terms & conditions|Contact us|All topics|All writers|Modern Slavery Act|Digital newspaper archive|Facebook|YouTube|Instagram|LinkedIn|Twitter|Newsletters|Advertise with us|Guardian Labs|Search jobs|Patrons|Back to top|\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I've had enough hassle over the estate as it is.\"|He is understandably relieved that the legal wrangles have been ironed out and that Marc's legacy is now coming through.|There is no suggestion of course that the trustees of Marc's affairs - Wizard (Bahamas) - have acted with anything less than strict regard for the legal rules.|It is only thanks to the determined efforts of Marc's record producer, Tony Visconti, that the way has finally been cleared.|He explains: \"Gloria and Marc never married, there was still a legal wife - June - in the background and Rolan suffered from archaic laws which don't allow an illegitimate child to inherit as of right.|\"The Estate of Marc Bolan stopped Rolan getting any regular payments. They were also holding up my own royalties as producer.|\"I successfully sued and it opened the gates for Rolan, because I got through. The Bolan fortune was quite a huge sum.\"|After a lengthy battle, the Trust has now arranged that Gloria and Rolan, who lives with his stepbrother, Walter Therman, can have a house from the investments in LA and that he will be given a \"controlled\" yearly allowance from the trust fund.|Marc's funeral was a hugely emotional affair, with thousands of fans sobbing as his coffin - topped by a huge floral white swan - was carried into the crematorium at Golders Green.|The tree on Barnes Common where the car crashed is a shrine permanently decked with flowers.|To commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, and his 60th birthday, there are TV documentaries, a double CD package called T.Rex - Greatest Hits and an exhibition of Bolan photos at London's Redfern Gallery.|On September 30, which would have been Marc's 60th birthday, there is to be a gala cabaret night, Bolan's Birthday Boogie, at London's Cafe de Paris which will feature a soundscape of his hits and evocative songs.|The evening will include the world premiere of A Fantasia Bolanesque, starring guest artists, including Boy George.|Rolan and Gloria Jones, and Marc's brother Harry Feld - a taxi driver - have been invited as guests of honour.|Gloria now helps run a children's orphanage in one of the poorest areas of Sierra Leone, West Africa, where she is also building the Marc Bolan School Of Music.|\"I want this time to be a celebration,\" she insists.|\"It is sad he is not here to see for himself how his music has lived on, but he was a happy person so everyone should be happy for him.|\"It is ironic that he is probably even bigger now than he was in his heyday.\"|She says she still finds it difficult to talk about the car crash.|\"I didn't come out of shock for 14 years. Marc was my soul-mate and we believed we had a great future together, which makes his death all the harder to bear.|\"There was the rock 'n' roll side to Marc, but really he was a quiet, humble boy.|\"I never saw the addictive side of him. Once Rolan was born he became a hands-on dad, and was very proud of him.\"|Says Rolan now: \"I've never tried to be like my father. Lately, I have been creating my own identity and impressing on people that they can be a fan of my father and still enjoy my music.|\"So I think any pressure I felt being 'son of Marc Bolan' has kind of gone away.\"|But after all the grief he has felt, he doesn't complain.|\"There are many times when I feel him around. Once I dreamed I was backstage at one of his shows and we talked as if we were really good friends but he didn't know I was his son.|\"Then I was in the audience and he pointed at me and he knew me. I woke up really happy.|\"Now, I go into a recording studio and I instinctively feel his spirit encouraging me, advising me.|\"If there is a problem in my life, I wonder what Dad would have done and I feel the answer coming into my head.|\"It's not as good as having him around in the flesh, but it is the next best thing.\"|Register for free to continue reading|Sign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events.|ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT?|LOG IN|Email|Please enter a valid email|Please enter a valid email|First name|Please enter a valid email|Please|Last name|2005|2004|2003|2002|2001|2000|1999|1998|1997|1996|1995|1994|1993|1992|1991|1990|1989|1988|1987|1986|1985|1984|1983|1982|1981|1980|1979|1978|1977|1976|1975|1974|1973|1972|1971|1970|1969|1968|1967|1966|1965|1964|1963|1962|1961|1960|1959|1958|1957|1956|1955|1954|1953|1952|1951|1950|1949|1948|1947|1946|1945|1944|1943|1942|1941|1940|1939|1938|1937|1936|1935|1934|1933|1932|1931|1930|1929|1928|1927|1926|1925|1924|1923|1922|1921|1920|1919|1918|1917|1916|1915|Year of birth|You must be at least 18 years old to create an account|Enter your password|Must be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number|I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.

          "|Speaking to The Independent on Sunday this weekend, Ms Aram described how she was driving just seconds behind Bolan on the ill-fated night: \"As I came over the bridge with Richard [Jones] beside me, I can still in my mind see, so clearly, a purple car which looked like a little beetle. It was upright and it was smoking and there was a tiny glimmer of light from the moon, the night was so still.\"|The \"little beetle\" was the Mini driven by Gloria Jones. Ms Aram said she didn't immediately stop at the car but drove a few metres past it.|\"I said 'we've got to get them out, this car might blow up'. I took my mother's rug from the back of my car and put it on the ground. Some of the fans are comforted by the fact he was laid on a nice lady's rug. I don't think Richard thought Marc was dead, but I knew he was. Gloria was groaning and almost conscious. But Richard cried and said 'please don't leave me'.\" In an eerie parallel with Bolan's death, Ms Aram said she crashed into a tree on the way to give evidence at Bolan's inquest a month later.|At the height of his fame in the early to mid-1970s, Bolan \u2013 born Mark Feld \u2013 outsold Jimi Hendrix and The Who with his band T Rex. But his good looks, catchy songs, air of mystique and untimely death at the age of 29 meant interest in the star has never waned.|Fee Warner, founder of the T Rex Action Group, bought the land where the sycamore tree stands to stop it from being felled. She and volunteers preserve the shrine dedicated to Bolan. Ms Warner, 53, said: \"A lot of people don't realise there was a fence between the tree and the road, because the fence was removed. When we came to build some steps, we found that when they had taken the fences away, they had taken away the ones that were undamaged, but the damaged ones had become buried on the site. That explains something which I have never been able to understand: why the damage to the tree is far higher than anything a Mini could have done.\"|Join our commenting forum|Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies|Comments|1|/|1|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|On the 35th anniversary of the glam rock star's death in a car accident, an eyewitness reveals what happened|\u2715|Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article|Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Rex Memorial|By|Eric Grundhauser|Photo: Chris/Creative Commons|Atlas Obscura on|Slate|is a blog about the world\u2019s hidden wonders. Like us on|Facebook|and|Tumblr|, or follow us on|Twitter|.|Father of the glam-rock trend during the 1970s along with his band\u00a0T. Rex, Marc Bolan was tragically killed, like so many rock stars, far too young, in a car accident in London in 1977.|Despite his influence on the pop cultural landscape of the 1970s,|the site of Bolan's death|was never officially recognized with a memorial. However, thanks to the musician's devoted fans, a shrine has been erected that continues to grow to this day.|Advertisement|The tribute to the musician began when lovers of Bolan's music began making pilgrimages to the site where the car in which he was a passenger collided with a tree. Visitors began hanging notes and trinkets from the sycamore tree the car had hit, which eventually spread to a posting board next to it. After years of devotional offerings being placed on the \"Bolan Tree,\" the branches started to give under the weight of the love hanging from its limbs, and the tree began to die.|Since the site was never officially recognized or cared for, no one knew what to do to save the tree, until a group of ultra-devoted fans formed the awesomely named \"T. Rex Action Group.\" TAG, as it came to be known, began caring for the spot and was eventually given ownership of the land in perpetuity. The group continues to look after and improve the site to this day.|Today a stone plaque has been added in addition to a bronze bust of the flamboyant performer. Bolan's musical influence continues to live, and new fans are born every day, assuring that the site of his death will continue to accumulate devotionals for another four decades.",

          "|]|Plaque marking Bolan's childhood home, 25|Stoke Newington|Common,|Hackney|.|Bolan was born at|Hackney Hospital|and grew up at 25 Stoke Newington Common, in the borough of|Hackney|, east London, the son of Phyllis Winifred (n\u00e9e Atkins) and Simeon Feld, a lorry driver. His father was an|Ashkenazi Jew|of Russian and Polish ancestry, while his mother was of|English|descent.|[7]|[8]|Moving to|Wimbledon|, southwest London, he fell in love with the rock and roll of|Gene Vincent|,|Eddie Cochran|,|Arthur Crudup|and|Chuck Berry|and hung around coffee bars such as|the 2i's|in|Soho|.|[9]|Bolan was a pupil at Northwold Primary School, Upper Clapton. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a|skiffle|band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\", a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old|Helen Shapiro|. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.|[10]|He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show|Orlando|, dressed as a|mod|. Bolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows.|Town|magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. When asked about his sexuality during an interview in 1975, Bolan said that he was bisexual.|[11]|Music career|[|edit|]|1964\u20131967: Early career|[|edit|]|In 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero,|Cliff Richard|, the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.|Bolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor|Allan Warren|, who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then \n-current source of inspiration,|Bob Dylan|. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.|[12]|Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"|Blowin' in the Wind|\" and|Dion|'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of|Betty Everett|'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.|Warren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul|David Kirch|, in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.|[13]|[14]|[15]|The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.|He signed to|Decca Records|in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from|James Bolam|, that it was a contraction of Bob Dylan, and \u2013 according to Bolan himself \u2013 that Decca Records chose the name.|[16]|He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with|the Ladybirds|on backing vocals (later finding fame with|Benny Hill|), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured|Jimmy Page|and|Big Jim Sullivan|, was produced by Jim Economides, with music director|Mike Leander|. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and|Donovan|. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In\", written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary|Fred Neil|, was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the|beat poets|. Neither song made the charts.|[9]|In 1966, Bolan turned up at|Simon Napier-Bell|'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album|The Beginning of Doves|). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death\", was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album|You Scare Me to Death|. Napier-Bell managed|the Yardbirds|and|John's Children|and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"|Desdemona|\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".|His tenure with the band was brief. Following an ill-fated German tour with|the Who|, Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (|The Krakenmist|and|Pictures Of Purple People|) as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth \u2013 he famously claimed to have spent time with a|wizard|in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that appeared on his first albums with|T. Rex|.|[9]|1967\u20131970: Tyrannosaurus Rex|[|edit|]|Bolan left John's Children when, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label|Track Records|. Unperturbed, he rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer|Steve Peregrin Took|and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in|Melody Maker|to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"|[9]|Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a|psychedelic|-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because Track Records had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"|[9]|The original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex with Took released three albums; two reached the top fifteen in the UK Albums Chart. They also had a top 40 hit \"Debora\" in 1968. They were supported with airplay by|BBC Radio 1|DJ|John Peel|.|[17]|One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free|Hyde Park concert|in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969\u201370 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.|[18]|It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.|[19]|In keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white|Fender|Stratocaster|decorated with a|paisley|teardrop motif from|Syd Barrett|. After replacing Took with|Mickey Finn|, he let the electric influences come forward even further on|A Beard of Stars|, the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by|Jimi Hendrix|.|[9]|1971\u20131975: T. Rex, glam rock and other styles|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan, the pixie prince of|glam rock|, remains a huge influence in music and fashion.|\u2014|Adam Sweeting|,|The Telegraph|.|[20]|Becoming more adventurous musically, Bolan bought a modified vintage|Gibson Les Paul|guitar (featured on the cover of the album|T. Rex|), and then wrote and recorded his first hit \"|Ride a White Swan|\", which was dominated by a rolling hand-clapping back-beat, Bolan's electric guitar and Finn's percussion. At this time he also shortened the group's name to T. Rex.|[9]|Bolan and his producer|Tony Visconti|oversaw the session for \"Ride a White Swan\", the single that changed Bolan's career which was inspired in part by|Mungo Jerry|'s success with \"|In the Summertime|\", moving Bolan away from predominantly acoustic numbers to a more electric sound.|[21]|Recorded on 1 July 1970 and released later that year, it made slow progress in the|UK Top 40|, until it finally peaked in early 1971 at number two.|[22]|Inspired by his muse, June Child, Bolan developed a fascination with women's clothing, an unlikely characteristic for a British male rocker at the time.|[23]|Bolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and|T. Rex|by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist|Steve Currie|and drummer|Bill Legend|, and cutting a five-minute single, \"|Hot Love|\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"|Hey Jude|\". Bolan performed \"Hot Love\" on the BBC television show|Top of the Pops|wearing glitter on his face: the performance was later recognized as the foundation of glam rock.|[3]|[24]|For the viewers, it was a defining moment: \"Bolan was magical, but also sexually heightened and|androgynous|\".|[3]|The song was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"|Get It On|\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song, re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the US, reached No. 10 in the|Billboard|Hot 100|in early 1972.|[3]|Dressed in a satin sailor suit, but also \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 with the glittery gold teardrops beneath his eyes. This performance is often acknowledged as the birth of glam. His androgynous style has been an enduring influence on fashion. From Gucci to Saint Laurent, fashion has long drawn inspiration from his style. He knew how to subvert gender norms into fantastical new shapes.|\u2014|Joobin Bekhrad,|The Guardian|, on Bolan's March 1971 appearance on|Top of the Pops|.|[24]|In November 1971, the band's record label,|Fly|, released the|Electric Warrior|track \"|Jeepster|\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for|EMI|, who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK.|In 1972, he achieved two more UK number ones with \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" taken from|The Slider|,  and two number twos in \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\".|[22]|In the same year he appeared in|Born to Boogie|, a documentary by|Ringo Starr|about T. Rex including a concert filmed at London's|Wembley Empire Pool|in March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at|John Lennon|'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and|Elton John|on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit. No T. Rex record was certified until 1985, as the record company has to pay for it, which Bolan's did not in the '70s.|[22]|Bolan took to wearing top hats and feather boas on stage as well as putting drops of glitter on each of his|cheekbones|. Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this \u2013 some say it was introduced by his|personal assistant|, Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on|Radio 1|that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then.  Other performers \u2013 and their fans \u2013 soon took up variations on the idea.|An outfit of Marc Bolan's on display at the|Hard Rock Cafe|in Sydney, Australia|The glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend|David Bowie|, whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which continued throughout his career. Bowie's 1972 song \"|All the Young Dudes|\"|name-checked|T. Rex.|[25]|Bowie's song \"|Lady Stardust|\" is generally interpreted as alluding to fellow glam rock icon Bolan. The original demo version was entitled \"He Was Alright (A Song for Marc)\"|[26]|In 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend|Jeff Lynne|on the|Electric Light Orchestra|songs \"|Ma-Ma-Ma Belle|\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from|On the Third Day|, as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.|[22]|For the following recording sessions, he recruited|soul|female singers for the backing vocals on \"|20th Century Boy|\", which peaked at number 3 in March, and mid-year \"The Groover\" which went to number four.|[22]|Tanx|, parts of which found him heading towards soul, funk and gospel, was both a commercial and critical success in several European countries. \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"|Teenage Dream|\" from the 1974 album|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend|Gloria Jones|on keyboards as well as backing vocals.|Eventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Jones, which began in July 1973. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums, putting|R & B|influences with rock on|Bolan's Zip Gun|. He was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working.|[9]|1976\u20131977: resurgence and final year|[|edit|]|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014|In September 1975 Gloria Jones gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from|tax exile|in the US and|Monaco|and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show|Supersonic|, directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, including \"New York City\" which reached the top 15. By then, Bolan was current with the music scene, incorporating disco elements in|Futuristic Dragon|and the single \"|Dreamy Lady|\". The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album,|Dandy in the Underworld|, and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along|punk|band|the Damned|as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday barely five years previously.|[9]|Later in 1977,|Granada Television|commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called|Marc|in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on|ITV|earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former|John's Children|\u2013bandmate|Andy Ellison|, then fronting the band|Radio Stars|.|[9]|Bolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival David Bowie was the final guest on the last episode of|Marc|. Bowie's solo song|\"Heroes\"|was the show's penultimate song; Bolan signed off, naming some of the musicians: \"All the cats; you know who they are\"; they then began to play a bluesy song, over the closing credits. After four words of Bowie's vocals, however, Bolan stumbled forward, and off the stage, but managed to grab the microphone, and find a smile. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.|[27]|Personal life|[|edit|]|Bolan began his first serious romantic relationship, with Teresa Whipman, in 1965.|[28]|They broke up in 1968 when Bolan met June Ellen Child. The pair immediately fell in love and moved into a flat together after only knowing each other for a few days.|[29]|They married on 30 January 1970.|[30]|She was a former secretary to his then managers,|Blackhill Enterprises|, also the managers of another of his heroes,|Syd Barrett|, whom June dated.|[31]|She was also influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.|[9]|Bolan's relationship with June was tumultuous; he engaged in several affairs over the course of their marriage, including one with singer|Marsha Hunt|in 1969, and another with artist|Barbara Nessim|while recording in America in 1971.|[32]|[33]|The couple separated in 1973, after June found out about Bolan's affair with his backing singer|Gloria Jones|.|[34]|After Bolan's death, June revealed that she had  abortions during their marriage because she believed Bolan was not mature enough to be a father.|[35]|[36]|Bolan and Gloria Jones were in a committed romantic relationship from 1973 until he died in September 1977.|[37]|The couple had a son together in September 1975 and the three of them lived together as a|nuclear family|for nearly two years until Bolan's death. At the end of June 1976, June Bolan sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery, citing Gloria Jones as the third party. At the court hearing on 5 October 1976, Deputy Judge Donald Ellison declared: \"I am satisfied that the husband committed adultery with the co-respondent, and that the wife finds it intolerable to live with him\", and granted a decree nisi. Twelve months after that date, it was to become a decree absolute thus severing the Bolans' matrimonial ties. \"The facts are that she initially left me, and we just grew apart,\" Bolan explained after the ruling. \"There were no great scenes, no smashing things up. It just suddenly happened one day. We weren't a couple anymore.\" He also used the opportunity to shed a little light on his sexuality. \"Anyway, I'm gay,\" he only half-jested. \"I can't say I was a latent homosexual \u2013 I was an early one. But sex was never a great problem. I'm a great screwer\". Asked about the institution of marriage, he replied: \"Gloria doesn't want to get married and neither do I. If I ever marry anyone again, I'll put in a clause that when it ends you're on your own \u2013 and that means financially, too.\"|[38]|Death|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|at the site where he died in a car crash in|Barnes, London|on 16 September 1977, two weeks shy of what would have been his 30th birthday.|Bolan never learnt to drive, fearing a premature death.|[39]|[40]|Despite this fear, cars or automotive components are at least mentioned in, if not the subject of, many of his songs. He also owned a number of vehicles, including a white 1960s|Rolls-Royce|that was loaned by his management to the band|Hawkwind|on the night of his death.|[41]|[42]|On 16 September 1977, Bolan was a passenger in a|Mini 1275GT|driven by Gloria Jones as they headed home from Mortons club and restaurant in|Berkeley Square|. Both had been drinking wine, and after she crossed a small|humpback bridge|near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, the car struck a fence post|[43]|and then a tree.|[44]|[45]|Bolan was killed instantly, while Jones suffered a broken arm and broken jaw.|[43]|[45]|The car crash site has become a shrine to his memory, where fans leave tributes beside the tree. In 2013, the shrine was featured on the|BBC Four|series|Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places|.|[46]|The site,|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|, is owned and maintained by the T. Rex Action Group.|[47]|Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Crematorium|Memorial plaque to Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium|His funeral service was held on 20 September 1977 at the|Golders Green Crematorium|in|North London|, where his ashes were later buried under a rose bush. At Bolan's funeral, attended by David Bowie,|Rod Stewart|,|Tony Visconti|and|Steve Harley|,|[48]|a swan-shaped floral tribute was displayed outside the service in recognition of his breakthrough hit single \"|Ride a White Swan|\".|There are two plaques dedicated to his memory at the Crematorium. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on\u00a0\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.|Bolan had arranged a discretionary|trust|to safeguard his money. A small, separate|Jersey|-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330\u00a0million (approx $38\u00a0\u2013 $57\u00a0million), remains in trust.|[49]|Legacy|[|edit|]|The T. Rex singer captivated generations with his strutting music and hyper-sexual charisma.|\u2014|Alexis Petridis|in|The Guardian|on \"glam's greatest icon\".|[3]|Bolan strongly influenced artists of many genres, including glam rock,|punk|,|post-punk|,|new wave|,|indie rock|,|Britpop|and|alternative rock|. After seeing Bolan wearing|Zandra Rhodes|-designed outfits,|Freddie Mercury|enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next|Queen|tour in 1974.|[50]|Bolan was the early guitar idol of|Johnny Marr|, who later found fame as the guitarist of the influential|indie rock|band|the Smiths|.|[51]|In 1979,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to the single \"|The Staircase (Mystery)|\". The band had played the song live for several months and on the first anniversary of Bolan's death in 1978 played the song as the encore when they performed at Aylesbury Friars. Emerging in the|New Romantic|movement in the early 1980s,|Boy George|spoke of the impact Bolan and Bowie had on him: \"They represented a kind of bohemian existence that I \u2013 at that point \u2013 could only imagine living. I loved the music. The first time I ever saw Marc Bolan really, properly was singing 'Metal Guru' and just loved him. I don't think you can separate an artist from what they wear or what they sing \u2013 it's kind of the complete package.\"|[52]|In December 1980, \"Telegram Sam\" was the fourth single released by British gothic rock band|Bauhaus|. Also in 1980,|the Bongos|were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the|Billboard|charts with a T.Rex cover. Since then, Bongos frontman|Richard Barone|has recorded several other Bolan compositions (\"The Visit,\" \"Ballrooms of Mars\"), worked with T.Rex producer|Tony Visconti|for his current solo album,|Glow|(2010,|Bar/None Records|) that includes a remake of Bolan's \"Girl\" from|Electric Warrior|, and has himself produced tracks for Bolan's son Rolan. In 1983,|NWOBHM|band|Girlschool|covered \"20th Century Boy\" on their|Play Dirty|.

They also performed the tune (with|Michael Des Barres|replacing Palmer) at the|Live Aid|concert. In 1986,|Violent Femmes|covered the song \"Children of the Revolution\" on their album,|The Blind Leading the Naked|.|[54]|In 1989,|X|released a live cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to their single \"|Kurenai|\".

          "|Willner assembled the album because he felt Bolan was an overlooked figure: he noted that he \u201cwas hardly ever talked about as a composer\u201d, the conversation more often turning to \u201chow David Bowie took his essence and Bolan was in his shadow\u201d. That is certainly true in the US, where Get It on was T Rex\u2019s solitary hit, but the degree of enthusiasm the artists involved have for Bolan\u2019s work is enough to startle even a diehard T Rex obsessive like me.|Kesha was born a decade after|Bolan\u2019s death in 1977 in a car crash|and first heard T Rex in the early 00s. \u201cI just remember thinking, whatever this music was, it was the soundtrack of my soul: it really helped me unleash things inside me. I feel like I was raised by T Rex, because I didn\u2019t have a dad, so male figures in my life were the ones I\u2019d read about or listen to.\u201d|\u2018I feel like I was raised by T Rex\u2019 ... Kesha.|Photograph: Dana Trippe|What continues to attract musicians to an artist whose imperial phase lasted barely two years? The music, obviously: the golden run of singles that begins with 1970\u2019s Ride a White Swan and ends with 1973\u2019s 20th Century Boy; the insouciant, sexually charged brilliance of the albums Electric Warrior and The Slider. The image: what the Edge calls \u201cthat transgressional thing of challenging stereotypes and being this ambiguous creature \u2026 that really did create a new kind of space\u201d. The sense that, while other artists ultimately sold more records or had longer careers, it is hard to think of anyone who has been better at actually|being a pop star|than Bolan, with his self-mythologising lyrics \u2013 \u201cI drive a Rolls-Royce / \u2019Cos it\u2019s good for my voice\u201d \u2013 his interviews filled with wild claims and outrageously entertaining lies, his looks, his charisma.|\u201cHe was the perfect pop star,\u201d says John. \u201cHis songs were great, his records rocked, he had attitude, he had performing skills, he looked fabulous, he dressed the part. At a time when I was still becoming|Elton John|, he was a great role model. I thought: \u2018This guy doesn\u2019t give a fuck, he\u2019s just being who he is and he\u2019s loving every single minute of it.\u2019 And that had a great effect on me.\u201d|\u2018Maybe he could be running a cult in Fiji\u2019 ... Devendra Banhart.|Photograph: Ernesto Notarantonio/Ipa/Rex/Shutterstock|For another of the album\u2019s contributors, the singer-songwriter|Devendra Banhart|, part of Bolan\u2019s appeal is \u201cthe idea of switching up your style without any real concern, because he was really going for it\u201d. By the time of his first minor flush of fame in the late 60s, the former Marc Feld had already been a teenage mod who appeared in Town magazine, boasting about how many ties he owned, and a Dylan-inspired folkie called Toby Tyler, before becoming Marc Bolan, the author of two Donovan-esque flop solo singles and the guitarist and second vocalist in the Who-esque troublemakers John\u2019s Children.|Then came Tyrannosaurus Rex, an acoustic duo featuring Bolan and the percussionist Steve Peregrin-Took, but with the former evidently calling all the shots. Perhaps noting that Bolan was less committed to flower power idealism than he was to becoming famous, some areas of London\u2019s hippie counterculture regarded him with a jaundiced eye (\u201cHe was a cocky little shit,\u201d complains one underground luminary in Jonathon Green\u2019s definitive oral history of the era, Days in the Life), but the music Tyrannosaurus Rex made was frequently extraordinary. For an acoustic duo with a penchant for whimsy, they seldom sounded laid back: their songs charge along chaotically, fuelled by riffs and an energy closer to early rock\u2019n\u2019roll than folk.|Watch Nick Cave sing T Rex\u2019s Cosmic Dancer for the new tribute album Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T Rex|\u201cI just thought: \u2018Where the fuck has this come from?\u2019\u201d remembers John. \u201cI suppose it was a little like the Incredible String Band, but they were folkies \u2013 Marc Bolan was something different. He was sitting there in a cloak covered in stars, writing songs that sounded like Chuck Berry, very simple songs.|What?|\u201d|Banhart says: \u201cThe first time I heard Tyrannosaurus Rex, I thought: \u2018I am home. I\u2019m just in love. These are the best lyrics, this is the most fun energy, this is what real punk is to me. The nakedness of it. Led Zeppelin can hide behind these bombastic, heavy, aggressive walls of sound in order to sing about Mordor, but Marc is just singing about this wild, fantastical, Tolkienish world with nothing but the exoticness of his character.|\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the rock\u2019n\u2019roll thing, songs about cars, celebrating the interior of his Mustang Ford: \u2018It\u2019s all put together with alligator leather.\u2019 It isn\u2019t really psychedelic, it\u2019s a very particular thing.\u201d|Team spirit ... with Mickey Finn, who joined Bolan\u2019s band in its Tyrannosaurus Rex guise, in 1971.|Photograph: Araldo di Crollalanza/Rex|Over four albums, and with the help of|the producer Tony Visconti|, Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s sound expanded, Bolan gradually cranking up his electric guitar. You can hear vague intimations of what was going to happen \u2013 on the 1969 single King of the Rumbling Spires and on A Beard of Stars, the first album Bolan recorded with the percussionist Mickey Finn replacing Peregrin-Took \u2013 but clearly no one expected Ride a White Swan, the first release under the snappier name T Rex: sharper, more streamlined, more poppy, every instrument drenched in the kind of slapback echo found on old rock\u2019n\u2019roll records. The lyrics still sounded hippyish, but if any record can claim to have announced the arrival of the 70s, it is Ride a White Swan. \u201cI heard John Peel play it and I thought: \u2018This is amazing,\u2019\u201d says John. \u201cIt sounded like something that had come down from a spaceship; it was so out-there.\u201d|Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us|The Edge|It eventually reached No 2. Bolan expanded T Rex\u2019s lineup, bringing in the drummer Bill Legend and the bassist Steve Currie, and overhauled his image at the behest of his manager\u2019s wife, Chelita Secunda \u2013 out with the hippy cloaks, in with girls\u2019 clothes, satin and makeup (\u201cHe wore makeup during the day,\u201d remembers John, \u201cwhich I\u2019d never seen a man do before \u2013 I thought that was so cool\u201d). He played on his looks, amped up the sexuality in his music \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m gonna SUCK you,\u201d he howled on Jeepster \u2013 and that was that for the next two years: four No 1 singles, three No 1 albums, a film directed by Ringo Starr, hysteria the press called T Rextasy. There was far more depth to his songs than he was given credit for at the time \u2013 as Banhart points out, between \u201cthe flashiness, the smart lines, the cool boasts\u201d, there was a curious darkness in his lyrics: \u201cAll schools are strange\u201d, \u201cI danced myself into the tomb\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I\u2019m like me\u201d. Perhaps people couldn\u2019t hear over the screaming.|\u2018An understanding that things could be magical\u2019 ... U2\u2019s the Edge.|Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty Images|\u201cIt felt like he actually cast a spell,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt every aspect of how he presented himself was just an outpouring of his understanding that things could be magical, things could be heightened. Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us.\u201d|And then it went wrong. His grip on the songwriting he had honed to a kind of minimalist perfection on 1972\u2019s Metal Guru \u2013 a single that sounds like one long chorus \u2013 faltered. Bolan was rattled by his failure to break the US. \u201cI think he was just too androgynous for a lot of folks here,\u201d suggests Joan Jett, another Angelheaded Hipster contributor, who says Bolan was her first teenage crush. \u201cRadio just went for the safer stuff. I know from being in the Runaways how everyone treated us, so I just know they would have had issues with a Marc Bolan type of guy.\u201d|Bolan with his partner Gloria Jones, a former Motown staff writer.|Photograph: Estate of Keith Morris/Redferns|He was|smart enough to call time on glam|with 1974\u2019s elegiac single Teenage Dream and sharp enough to spot that the next thing might be a kind of rock/soul hybrid some time before his longstanding frenemy David Bowie decamped to Philadelphia. But having had the right idea, he couldn\u2019t quite make it work.|Bowie\u2019s Young Americans|sounded like an effortless reinvention. For all the bona fides of his|new partner Gloria Jones|\u2013 a former staff writer at Motown \u2013 Bolan\u2019s brand of plastic soul often felt like hard going, overstuffed with ideas. The other members of T Rex left, one by one, leaving him to front a band of session musicians. Tony Visconti baled out after 1974\u2019s poorly received Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow, claiming Bolan would no longer listen to anyone but yes-men.|Occasionally, something sparked, as on 1975\u2019s brilliant Think Zinc, but the album it came from, Bolan\u2019s Zip Gun, failed to chart.|Still, a prevailing wind started blowing in his favour once more. He had a couple of strong hits, New York City and I Love to Boogie, curbed the excesses that had left him looking bloated and finally nailed the soul-inspired sound on his great 1976 album Futuristic Dragon. Moreover, the emerging punk scene was staffed by people who had grown up in front of Top of the Pops at the height of T Rextasy and taken notes: three chords, distorted guitars, killer singles, be outrageous. Under punk\u2019s scorched-earth policy, vast tranches of rock\u2019s past were dismissed: T Rex were not.|\u201cThere was incredible discipline in T Rex\u2019s work,\u201d says the Edge. \u201cElectric Warrior is full of what I would call rock\u2019n\u2019roll 45s, which is such a rare thing: using rock and blues and guitar, but not losing sight of making great, accessible songs that have hooks and ideas and groove. They were an amazing band from that point of view, and that\u2019s the thing that I think a lot of rock lost sight of, progressive rock and whatever \u2013 whatever it was, it was not sexy music. I think the T Rex discipline is what gave them the chance to survive.\u201d|The admiration was mutual. Most established artists mocked or dismissed punk, or simply looked on with detached bemusement. Bolan, however, jumped in feet first: it seemed to activate the wild enthusiasm that John remembers: \u201cHe was always encouraging, never belittling; being with him was like having a hundred B12 injections at once.\u201d|Happy family ... Bolan and the Ramones in London, 1976.|Photograph: Richard Young/Rex|Bolan was in the audience for the Ramones\u2019 first UK gig. He took the Damned on tour with him and peppered his kids\u2019 TV show, Marc, with appearances by punk bands. You could say the fact that he was now presenting a kids\u2019 TV show was evidence of how far his star had fallen, but Bolan was pretty magnificent on it,|mercilessly hamming it up for the cameras|. \u201cThis is a new group called Generation X. They have a lead singer called Billy Idol who\u2019s supposed to be as pretty as me,\u201d he murmurs, effetely sniffing a flower. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d|A week after recording that link,|Bolan was dead, aged 29|. The premature death of an artist inevitably conjures a lot of what-ifs. It is tempting to wonder what might have happened had Bolan lived to see the glitter-obsessed denizens of the Blitz club and the synth era; to hear the Smiths rewriting Metal Guru as Panic or Get It on recast as Oasis\u2019s Cigarettes and Alcohol; or to enjoy British glam finally gaining US commercial success by proxy thanks to heavy metal: Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Slash stole his image from Bolan\u2019s Slider-era top hat and curls look; Def Leppard\u2019s Joe Elliott claimed that Pour Some Sugar on Me was an attempt to mimic T Rex\u2019s lyrics.|And it is tempting to wonder what Bolan might have made of another pre-eminent musical genius who clearly listened to T Rex, which Prince made explicit when he released his 1991 Bolan homage, Cream. \u201cWhen I met Prince, I thought he was like Marc: ethereal, very androgynous,\u201d says John. \u201cIf you look at the two of them, they\u2019re very similar, the way they posed. I can imagine Prince singing Telegram Sam, I can imagine Marc singing Raspberry Beret.\u201d|Glitter and curls: Marc Bolan and the birth of glam rock style|Read more|The truth is that he would have probably taken it all as his due \u2013 whatever his flaws, being crippled by modesty wasn\u2019t among them \u2013 just as he would taken Angelheaded Hipster and the praise from younger artists. \u201cHis attitude has really informed the way I look at my life,\u201d says|Kesha|. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t know what to do, like how to feel or how to behave, I think of people like Marc Bolan and all of a sudden it becomes more fun.\u201d|\u201cWhat would he be doing if he were alive today?\u201d muses Banhart. \u201cHe could be what Elon Musk is. Or he could maybe be running a cult in Fiji, with him as the head of his own New Light of Dawn, the head of the Bolarian cult. Maybe he\u2019s the person that they\u2019d hire to do the prequel to Game of Thrones. \u2018George RR Martin, he\u2019s taking too long \u2013 get Bolan on the phone.\u2019\u201d|Those sound like precisely the kind of wild claims Bolan would have made for himself. Banhart laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s it. But he was one of those one-of-a-kind people, where you go: \u2018Yeah, sure, all right. No one else can get away with that. But you can.\u2019\u201d|Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T Rex is out now on BMG|Marc Bolan\u2019s deep cuts, chosen by Alexis Petridis|This playlist largely avoids T Rex\u2019s biggest hits, incredible as they are, in favour of taking a slightly more serpentine path through Bolan\u2019s oeuvre. We open with The Wizard, the solo debut single that began Bolan\u2019s myth-building \u2013 he claimed he had studied sorcery under the titular sorcerer in France; his manager,|Simon Napier-Bell|, unsportingly suggested that Bolan had just met a man who did conjuring tricks in a Paris nightclub. Then there are the fantastic, wild, freakbeat singles Bolan wrote for John\u2019s Children that underlined the impossibility of him ever functioning merely as a band\u2019s backing singer: his voice looms out of the mix, overpowering everything else, a bizarre, quavering bleat he had apparently designed to draw as much attention to himself as possible.|Listen to Alex Petridis\u2019s Marc Bolan playlist|Spotify|The playlist picks its way along Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s path from hippy oddity to proto-glam. You can hear intimations of what was going to happen next on Mustang Ford\u2019s conflation of cars and sex, and in the sound of King of the Rumbling Spires, By the Light of a Magical Moon and Elemental Child. And it takes in Banhart\u2019s favourite Bolan lyric: Scenescof\u2019s distinctly punk \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to dictate all my fun\u201d. Here are 30 reasons to \u2013 as the man himself was fond of saying \u2013 keep a little Marc in your heart.|Topics|Pop and rock|U2|Elton John|Kesha|Devendra Banhart|Celebrity|features|Reuse this content|Most viewed|Most viewed|Film|Music|TV & radio|Books|Art & design|Stage|Games|Classical|News|Opinion|Sport|Culture|Lifestyle|Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning|Sign up for our email|About us|Help|Complaints & corrections|SecureDrop|Work for us|Privacy policy|Cookie policy|Terms & conditions|Contact us|All topics|All writers|Modern Slavery Act|Digital newspaper archive|Facebook|YouTube|Instagram|LinkedIn|Twitter|Newsletters|Advertise with us|Guardian Labs|Search jobs|Patrons|Back to top|\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

          "|Nineteen forty-seven also marked the birth of the semiconductor revolution. Bell Laboratory scientists William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain announced the invention of the Bipolar Junction Transistor. The discovery caused little commotion at the time, but soon everyone would be carrying their own personal transistor radios. Three decades later, semiconductor manufacturers around the world would be spewing out millions of tiny microprocessors, each carrying well over a million transistors and capable of executing over one-hundred-million instructions per second.|In sports, Jackie Robinson became the first black man to sign a contract \nwith a major baseball club and New York beat Brooklyn to win the 1947 \nWorld Series.|Britain had just come through its most severe winter since 1894. But the cold of winter was quickly forgotten as the country prepared itself for a royal wedding between the heir to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, and Philip Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh.|And in the East London suburb of Hackney, a working-class Jewish couple, Simeon and Phyllis Feld, were expecting a child. Phyllis worked days at a fruit stand in Soho while Simeon worked at various odd jobs including cosmetic salesman and truck driver. On September 30th, 1947, the couple gave birth at Hackney General Hospital to a son and they named him Mark.|As far as Mark was concerned, he was born a star. \"When I was younger\", he recalled, \"I certainly thought I was a superior kind of being. And I didn't feel related to other human beings.\" Mark's parents remember him as a very strong willed boy who would kick anyone he didn't like. He had his share of fights during his school years and was a member of a local gang known as the Sharks. On one occasion, Mark claimed to have been knifed during a fight with a rival gang.|Mark had a strong imagination and would often make believe that he was Audie Murphy, Mighty Joe Young, or the Phantom of the Opera. He was also an avid movie fan. He most enjoyed science fiction and horror films and could name every title, actor, producer, and director.|Mark gained an appreciation for music at an early age spending hours listening to his parent's record collection. His favorite was a song about an American frontiersman from Tennessee, a place far away and much different than the London Mark grew up in. The song was \"The Ballad of Davey Crockett\" by an American songwriter named Bill Hayes. Mark's father, eager to encourage his son's interest in music, went out shopping one day to buy another record by his son's favorite musician, but he made an innocent mistake that would change the course of Mark's life forever. Instead of buying another record by Bill Hayes, Simeon confused the name with another American. The artist was Bill Haley and the song was \"Rock Around The Clock\". At age eight, Mark Feld had been handed his calling.|The Young Mark Feld|It didn't take long for Mark to act on his love for music. He first built himself a makeshift guitar which he used to learn the basics. He then talked his indulgent parents into buying him a drum kit. Later, when he was nine they bought him a guitar for 16 pounds which was nearly a month of Simeon's salary.|His mother would later recall how Mark would go to see someone like Cliff Richard in concert and come home saying \"that's how I'll be one day.\" Among his earliest compatriots were Keith Reid, future lyricist for Procul Harum, Cat Stevens, and a young man whose life would often be intertwined with his own, David Bowie.|Mark began to build a record collection with money he made doing odd jobs which included serving espresso behind the counter at the legendary 2 I's on Old Compton Street. The 2 I's served as a launching pad for many famous British acts including a young man named Harry Webb who would later change his name to Cliff Richard. Mark himself auditioned there, supposedly on the same day as did Harry Webb, but was turned down.|At age 12 Mark joined a 3 piece band called Susie and The Hula Hoops as a tea-chest bass player. The band's lead vocalist was named Helen Shapiro. Helen would eventually leave the band and within months record a string of pop-hit singles including two number 1 hits in Britain. Although Mark would deny that it had any impact on him, many believed that her success spurred him on to pursue his own path to stardom. He dropped out of school, having already been expelled, and went in search of an opportunity in acting.|During this time Mark befriended the girls from a British TV show called \"Oh Boy\". The girls would take Mark to all of their performances at the Hackney Empire. It was there that Mark had one of his first face-to-face meetings with a contemporary rock star.|Rock and Roll had been born in the USA and was being exported to\nEurope by a handful of early American rock stars who's popularity\noverseas nearly dwarfed their popularity back home in the States. One\nof these stars was Eddie Cochran and it was he who happened to be at the Hackney Empire on this night for his first Brittish tour.|Eddie Cochran|As the story goes, following Eddie Cochran's performance at the Hackney Empire, Cochran handed his guitar to the then 13 year old starry eyed Mark Feld who proceeded to carry the guitar to Cochran's waiting limousine. It was a moment that Mark was always proud to relate and one that would often be singled out as an important event in Mark's life, as if that event - the act of having touched Eddie Cochran's guitar, had some greater, almost mystical, significance.|This story, unfortunately, has a tragic and perhaps eerily ironic ending. At the end of Cochran's tour of England, the taxi carrying Cochran, his girlfriend Sharon Sheely, and fellow American Rock Star Gene Vincent, blew a tire while on its way to the London Airport. The car swerved off the road and slammed into a lamp post. Several hours later, on April 17th, 1960, Eddie Cochran joined his good friend Buddy Holly on the list of early rockers who gained instant immortality through a tragic death.|At age 13 Mark spotted a man walking down the street in front of his house wearing clothes which would become typical of the Mod movement in Britain. The sight so impressed Mark that he began spending all of his money on similar clothes. Later, commenting on this period of his life, Mark would say that he had an obsession with clothes, owning forty suits and often changing them 4 or 5 times a day. \"I used to go home and literally pray to become a Mod,\" he would remember.|Bumping into Angus McGill one day, a writer for the Evening Standard, Mark bragged about all of the clothes he owned. McGill followed Mark home to see his collection of clothes. Impressed with what he saw, McGill recruited Mark for a feature article about the Mod scene in Town magazine, a forerunner of modern men's magazines such as GQ. The article was entitled 'Faces Without Shadows' and was written by a fellow named Peter Barnsley. It included some of the earliest photographs of Mark to ever appear in print. They were taken by Don McCullin - Later to become a famous war photographer.|Beneath one of the pictures Barnsley included the following paragraph which included a rather ominous prediction:|Mark As Model|\"Feld is fifteen years old, and still at school. His family has just moved from Stamford Hill to a pre-fab out in Wimbledon. Of this he does not approve. The queues of Teds outside the cinemas in Wimbledon look just like a contest for the worst haircut, he says. At least the boys of Stamford hill dress sharply, and who would want a new, clean house if it is in unsympathetic surroundings? Nonetheless cleanliness is of vital importance to him. Shining with soap and health, he is apparently tireless and often goes for days on end without any sleep; there is never a trace of fatigue or boredom in his face.\n\"What is the point of all this energy and all the soap and water? Where is the goal towards which he is obviously running as fast as his impeccably shod feet can carry him? It is nowhere. He is running to stay in the same place and he knows by the time he has reached his mid-twenties the exhausting race will be over and he will have lost.\"|Following these events Mark was introduced to a modeling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\". As such he was used as a model for their suits in their catalogues as well as a model for cardboard cutouts to be displayed in their shop windows. Whether because they were unimpressed or because they wanted to keep their catalogue fresh with new faces is uncertain, but he was never used again.|Mark then shifted his focus back towards music and, at age 17, made another attempt to kick-start a career in the business. Sporting a denim cap and playing an acoustic guitar, he decided to try his hand at the British folk circuit. The sound resembled a Dylan/Donovan mix and, indeed, his songs consisted of some Dylan covers and a few other folksy tunes. To complete the new look and sound, Mark even came up with a new name for himself. Thus it was that the short music career of Toby Tyler began.|Mark as Toby Tyler|It didn't take long until Toby met up with an actor named Allan Warren\nwho offered to become his manager. Allan helped arrange recording time\nfor Toby and they proceeded to record several tunes including Dylan's\n\"Blowin' in the wind\". A version of Betty Everett's \"You're No Good\"\nwas submitted to EMI for a test screening but they turned Toby\ndown. Deciding that the future for Toby Tyler looked bleak, Warren and\nToby parted company after which Toby Tyler once again became simply\nMark Feld. (There was one small change however, but it's not clear to\nme when exactly it occurred. And that is that somewhere around this\ntime period, Mark chose to drop the \"k\" from his name and replace it with a\n\"c\". Therefore, many poems and diaries from this period were signed as\nMarc Feld rather than as Mark Feld.)|The tapes produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished from thought and mind for over twenty-five years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly eight-thousand dollars. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available the earliest of Marc's known recordings.|With yet another attempt to get into the music business at a dead end, Marc found himself hanging around the National Theatre looking for work. He was able to land several character parts in some TV shows including a delinquent on the Sam Kydd TV series and a show called 'Orlando'. But TV acting bored Marc so he decided to take an extended trip to France.|The accounts of what happened in France differ and not even Marc ever seemed to tell the same story twice. He was known to occasionally stretch the truth or fabricate pieces of it and seemed to often forget which parts were real and which were fantasies. He once admitted to an interviewer that he felt that his credibility as a poet allowed him to stretch the truth or make things up.|In any case, according to Marc's accounts he met a magician who lived\nin a 40 room mansion with libraries of books on mythology and black\nmagic. Marc claimed to have witnessed levitations, seances, and\ncrucifixions of live cats. He even claimed to have at one point\nwitnessed a ceremony at which the attendees resorted to consumption of\nhuman flesh. All of this, recall, was from Marc's own\naccounts. According to one of Marc's early producers, Simon\nNapier-Bell, however, Marc had merely met a guy who did magic tricks\nand spent a weekend with him.|Whatever the real truth, the experience had a profound effect on Marc. He left France with a much more highly developed imagination and a near obsession with Greek mythology, British romantic poetry, and the Tolkien books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of The Rings\". The Tolkien books had reached nearly Biblical status with the sixties generation of hippies and they would have a tremendous influence on Marc's early song writing; manifesting themselves in the form of enchanted poems and lyrics.|Marc returned to Britain more determined than ever to become a star. He locked himself away for months writing songs in a manic frenzy of inspiration. His future wife would later describe his writing style in terms of \"a force flowing out of him\". He himself contributed it to the work of his Guardian Angel whom, he was sure, really did all of the writing. During this period of time, Marc would churn out a reservoir of songs which he would still be tapping into five albums later. Among them was a song which he entitled \"The wizard\" in honor of his wizardly friend in France. With the help of producer Jim Economedies, he recorded the song and landed a record contract with Decca.|When Marc received the initial samples of \"The Wizard\" from Decca he\nreceived a mild shock. His name had been changed again; but this time\nwithout his approval. Decca had decided that the name Marc Feld would\nNOT do and had changed his last name to \"Bowland\". The name change\ndidn't bother Marc as much as did the fact that he had not been\nconsulted about the matter. As would become typical of other events in\nhis future, Marc refused to allow Decca to have it their way without\nhis stamp of approval. After negotiations, he convinced them to drop\nthe W and the D from Bowland to shorten the name to BOLAN. Thus, Marc\nFeld became Marc Bolan and in November of 1965 \"The Wizard\" was\nreleased and the voice and music of Marc Bolan was broadcast for the\nfirst time over British airwaves.|Mark Feld as Marc Bolan|Decca's press release on the Wizard single was a masterpiece of sixties hype. It read:|\"Marc Bolan was born in September 1947. After 15 years had passed he traveled to Paris and met a black magician called The Wizard, He lived for 18 months in The Wizard's chateau with Achimedies, an owl, and the biggest, whitest Siamese cat you ever saw. He then felt the need to spend some time alone so he made his way to woods, near Rome. For two weeks he strove to find himself and then he returned to London where he began to write. His writings mirror his experiences with mentionings of the magician's pact with the great god Pan. In London, walking down Kings Road, Chelsea in the dead of night, he chanced to meet a girl named Lo-og who gave him a magic cat. This cat, named after the girl, is now his constant companion and is a source of inspiration to him. Now The Wizard's tale is set down for all to hear on Marc's first recording for Decca.\"|A small poem accompanied two photographs of Bolan. It read:|\"Standing alone in the wood, with the golden palace bleeding scarlet tears into the sunset, I thought of all the treasures in the magic palace. And all the emptiness in my stomach and I smiled secretly, Rememberin' the wizard's words.\"|A critic for Disc Magazine reviewed the Wizard as follows:|\"On the strength of this strange young man's looks and weird background I suspect we'll hear more of this odd record about meeting a Wizard in the woods who knew all. I prefer the other side, 'Beyond the Risin' Sun' which has more tune. Jim Economedies, ace producer, does lovely things on this. I'm a bit put off by the way this boy sings with Dylan phrasing but that's all.\"|A record contract doesn't mean instant success and Marc found himself hustling for interviews and write-ups. One of his first interviews as Marc Bolan was with Angus McGill, the same writer who had interviewed Marc years earlier about the Mod trend. According to Angus he simply did not recognize the new Marc. \"I had remembered him as a rather plain little chap\", he said, \"and suddenly there was the most glamorous young man you'd ever seen, all curls and exotic clothes. He played the record, which I thought was appalling and showed me some poetry which struck me as unmitigated rubbish. I never thought he'd make it. But then I once predicted that TV would never catch on either.\"|Keith Altham, Marc's future publicist who at this point in time was just an acquaintance, remembers Marc frequenting a bar called the Brewmaster. He would come in carrying his record and say \"Gotta listen to this fellas, I'm going to be the greatest thing since Elvis Presley.\" \"Nice little bloke Marc!\", they all thought, \"Sit down and have a Coca Cola.\" No one really expected him to get too far.|Marc performed \"The Wizard\" on the TV show \"Ready, Steady, Go\". Unfortunately, the band missed out on the intro, played too fast, and in the wrong key. To make matters worse the show encountered technical problems and the signal went dead for most of Marc's debut. It was a disaster.|In June of 66 Decca released a follow up single called \"The Third Degree\" backed by what Marc called an unfinished demo titled \"San Francisco Poet\". It flopped. This single was to have been followed up by a song called \"Jasper C. Debussy\" but by then Marc's contract with Decca had expired and Marc had moved on to Columbia and producer Simon Napier-Bell.|Following his lack of success with Decca, Marc called producer Simon Napier-Bell and told him \"I'm a singer and I'm going to be the biggest rock star ever, so I need a good manager to make all the arrangements.\" Simon told him to send him his demo tapes but Marc insisted that he was close by and could just drop them in. Ten minutes later he arrived at Simon's office with his guitar around his neck and announced that he had no demo tapes after all but would be happy to sing a few tunes for him. He sat in a chair cross-legged, accentuating his short stature, and played all the songs on acoustic guitar - enough, according to Simon, to fill nearly four albums. By the end of the set, Simon was on the phone booking some time in a local recording studio.|Simon recalled that Marc was ridiculously egotistical at the time, to the point where it was easy to get furious with him. He actually thought that all he needed to do was to make a few posters of himself and things would just sort of happen. Simon disagreed and convinced Mark to add some strings to one of the songs, called \"hippy gumbo\", and approach some record companies with it.|Unfortunately, none of the record companies liked the tune. When Simon told Marc the news, he was completely shattered - not even expecting to be turned down. Eventually however, Simon was able to convince Columbia records to take Marc on and the single was released in June of '67. This single was another flop and was greeted with bad reviews including one that called the single, quote, \"a crazed mixture of an incredibly bad negro blues singer and Larry the Lamb.\"|Marc made a second appearance on \"Ready, Steady, Go\" to promote 'Hippy Gumbo'. This appearance went much better than his first but it was overshadowed by the first British TV appearance of Jimi Hendrix. Marc later boasted that Hendrix told him how much he liked his voice but that he would never make it. In some respects this prediction was true in as much as by mid 1967 the short solo career of Marc Bolan had failed to take root.|Simon Napier-Bell happened to be producing two other groups at this point in time. One was The Yardbirds, which included future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Watching the Yardbirds work was one of the things Marc would later recall as one of the highlights of this period. The other band was a group called John's Children who were signed to the Who's label, Track.|John's Children had previously been known as the Silence which had developed from a number of even earlier bands such as the Clockwork Onions and The Few. The name John's Children came about because bass player John Hewlett was the leader of the band. The other band members were lead singer Andy Ellison, guitarist Geoff McClelland, and drummer Chris Townsen who occasionally deputized for the Who's Keith Moon. The band had already caused quite a stir in England after having done some nude publicity shots and performing some relatively wild stage acts. Today they are remembered as one of the first psychedelic bands of this era.|John's children had already released two singles. One was called \"The Love I Thought I'd Found\" which was released in America retitled as \"Smashed!! Blocked!!\". The second single was called \"Not The Sort Of Girl You Take To Bed\" which flopped. Following these two singles guitarist Geoff McClelland was kicked out of the band, having failed to live up to the expectations of his fellow band members or the owner of the Track record label, Kit Lambert, who was also the Who's manager at the time.|In addition to the Who, Lambert had signed Jimi Hendrix and John's Children to his record label but insisted that Marc Bolan be included in the deal as John's Children's guitarist. The deal was acceptable to Simon-Napier Bell who, having failed to make Marc Bolan a solo success, saw a union between John's Children and Marc as a move that would potentially benefit both parties. John's children would have a better guitarist as well as one that could write music and Marc could broaden his exposure by joining up with a band that had already established a following. Marc found the deal acceptable if for no other reason than he would be recording on the same record label as Jimi Hendrix whom he had immense respect for.|Bolan Era John's Children|The merger was made and the new line up of John's Children headed for the recording studio to put down some new tracks. After one week they emerged with several demos and releasable songs. The first to be released was a Bolan compilation called Desdemona. Andy Ellison performed the lead vocals on the song but Bolan's unique voice was unmistakably present on the background vocals. The single was released in May of '67 and initially appeared to be headed for the top of the charts. Unfortunately, The BBC dealt the song a fatal blow by banning the song because it considered the line \"lift up your skirt and fly\" to be offensive. Despite this the song was popular and to this day is considered to be one of the finest British releases of 1967.|Onstage, John's children were as controversial as their music. Andy Ellison was prone to getting excessively wild, jumping around the stage, leaping into the crowd and occasionally attacking other members of the band. Marc would swing between moods sometimes simply sitting cross-legged on the stage and other times running around the stage in circles.|In their private lives, however, Marc was clearly apart from the others. Andy Ellison would later recall that the rest of the band was into drugs and dropping acid while Marc would only occasionally sip a little wine and spent most of his time simply writing songs. This, among other reasons, was why the merger of Bolan with John's children was to be a relatively short-lived union.|Marc also grew increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that John, not he, was choosing the musical direction of the band. Their second single with Marc was to have been \"Midsummer Nights Scene\" with \"Sarah Crazy Child\" on the flip side - both Bolan compositions. But, for reasons that are still unclear, the single was shelved at the last minute even though it had already been pressed. In its place was released a Hewlett/Townsen number called \"Come And Play With Me In The Garden\".|Then, perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back, a concert in Ludswigshaven, Germany while touring Europe with the Who, nearly ended in disaster. Near the end of their set the band jumped into a song entitled \"You're a Nothing\" which ended with a repeated German chant. Andy Ellison grew quite a bit more wild than usual and jumped off the stage with a large sack of feathers that he had pulled from hotel pillows. While he went about the business of tossing feathers at the crowd, Marc began beating at his amps with chains, and the rest of the band began chanting the German slogan. Eventually, a riot broke out. Fans began to rush the stage and the band just narrowly made an escape to the safety of their limousines. They drove off just as the police began moving in armored cars to quell the riot. The Who had to cancel their act that night and the German government confiscated a good deal of John's Children's equipment.|Marc left the band soon after - less than 6 months after joining it.|But he left John's Children with a mission - to establish his own rock band under his own complete control. Still wielding the electric guitars and amps he had used with John's children, Marc put ads in the International Times looking for other musicians. Not patient enough to wait, he also booked a gig at the Electric Garden in London's Covent Garden, a club that would later change its name to \"Middle Earth\" after the mythical land in the Tolkien trilogies.|An 18 year old drummer named Steve Turner responded to the add. Marc hired him but convinced him to change his name to Steve Peregrine Took after the youngest of the four hobbits in the Lord of The Rings trilogy. The name change was fine for Steve apparently as long as Marc didn't mind being referred to as Nalob Cram - Marc Bolan spelled backwards.|Steve Peregrine Took|In addition to bringing a full drumkit to the band, Steve Took could also acceptably integrate several other strange instruments into the music such as kazoos and pixiephones. He could also handle backing vocals quite well being able to immediately find a harmony for nearly anything Marc sang. According to Marc's soon to be producer Tony Visconti, Steve was perhaps the only person who was ever able to really get inside Marc's head and travel the distance into the Middle Earth landscape where most of his musical themes took place.|In addition to Steve, Marc recruited a 28 year old bearded guitarist named Ben who, according to Steve, kept turning green with stomach ulcers and a bass guitarist who was also a lot older than Marc and Steve and smoked a pipe which clearly labeled him as an undesirable - or at least so thought Steve. There was one other member of the band, but little is documented or remembered about him. In fact, the identities of all three of these original band members remains a mystery today.|Marc needed a name for this new band. Naturally he wanted a name that reflected his belief in mythology but knew that most people didn't adhere to such beliefs. But Marc reasoned that modern science had firmly proven the existence of the dinosaurs; creatures that, far more than anything else known to man, encroached on the boundaries of mythology. And if such creatures had existed millions of years ago, then who could argue against the possibility that even long before they existed there may have been creatures more like fire breathing dragons and other mythological creatures. Following this reasoning, Marc decided to name his band after a dinosaur. But not just any dinosaur would do. It had to be the biggest and baddest of them all - the king of the dinosaurs; the Tyrannosaurus Rex.|With a new band and a new name, Marc headed for the Covent Garden. Time didn't allow for such trivialities as rehearsing so the band practiced together only once before the show. The result was disastrous. The band members were simply incompatible and the total lack of rehearsal understandably didn't help. The band was promptly booed off the stage and disbanded almost immediately afterwards. To make matters worse, Track records, who owned most of what remained of John's Children's equipment following the German fiasco, repossessed Marc's electric guitar and amps. Then, to scrape up enough cash to obtain the bare necessities of life, Steve had to sell his drumkit and replaced it with a simple pair of bongos.|Thus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, which Marc had started with the best of\nintentions, had disintegrated into a 2 piece band owning only a set of\nbongos and an acoustic guitar. They may well have vanished from the\nmusic histories altogether had it not been for the support of a very\nearly ally and big fan - radio disk jockey|John Peel|.|Tyrannosaurus Rex|John had operated an illegal offshore radio station which was eventually shut down by the BBC. But being illegal allowed Peel to play lots of music NOT allowed or sanctioned by the BBC including underground bands like Tyrannosaurus Rex. After the offshore radio was shut down, Peel was hired by the Middle Earth club and immediately recruited the fledgling Tyrannosaurus Rex as a house band. Later, after landing a job at Radio One, John would often invite Tyrannosaurus Rex to play live on his show. Some of these recordings along with those from many other bands are currently available on a series of albums and CDs known as the Peel sessions. John also made sure that whenever he was asked to MC at clubs throughout England, Tyrannosaurus Rex was brought along as his warm-up band. Eventually, this exposure began to build a following for the band and they were soon being asked to play at various colleges and open air festivals around England. They even appeared at the first free Hyde Park festival in 1968.|Thus, with John Peel's help, Marc's Tyrannosaurus Rex survived the Winter of 1968. Aside from a few rough cuts released on an album years later called \"The Beginning of Doves\", little in the form of recordings is available of Tyrannosaurus Rex from those early days and, historically, it's fair to say that Tyrannosaurus Rex was dormant and would remain so until the thaw of spring.\n\n<!-- Play version of \"Beyond the Rising Sun\" on Doves. ->|[Home]|[Next Chapter]",

Photo credit: BBC|T-Rex fans will be delighted with the news that the British glam rockers will \u201cofficially\u201d be acknowledged as rock and roll legends being nominated along with Whitney Houston and Biggie Smalls aka Notorious B.I.G into the 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The significance in this historical moment musically speaking is how the main operator behind the band, Marc Bolan took the definition of what rock and roll is all about to another dimension with his musical range that remains to be impressive by today\u2019s standards.|According to\u00a0Gloria Jones, Bolan\u2019s then girlfriend, bandmate and mother of their son, Rolan Feld Bolan said to|Billboard|,|\u201cHe was a very humble spirit, but he understood who he was. He understood his worth.\u201d Nevertheless, Jones adds, the glam rock pioneer, \u201cwould have been very, very honored, and I\u2019m sure he would have been brought to tears. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very happy, and he\u2019s very honored.\u201d|Why Marc Bolan Remains To Be A Glam Rebelling Rock Icon \u2013 A Flamboyant Identity That Thwarts The Restraints of Society Standards|Marc Bolan was way ahead of his time in his short career as one of the top charting artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
          "|Much has been made of exactly how the glitter ended up on Bolan\u2019s cheeks. In a 1974 BBC interview, Bolan said: \u201cThere was some of my wife\u2019s glitter and I just spit on me fingers and stuck it under me eyes. I thought it looked cute \u2026\u201d|In one Bolan biography, his then wife, June Child, claimed the idea was hers. Numerous sources, however, cite Chelita Secunda, the wife of Bolan\u2019s manager at the time, as the woman behind the glitter. \u201cChelita was a muse to Marc Bolan,\u201d remarked artist Duggie Fields in Michael Bracewell\u2019s book Roxy: The Band That Invented an Era. \u201cIndeed, being the instigator of Marc\u2019s addiction to glitter and women\u2019s clothes, she can be held responsible for much of the look now referred to as glam rock.\u201d In Paul Trynka\u2019s biography, David Bowie: Starman, the DJ Jeff Dexter is quoted as saying that Chelita gave Bolan some glitter at her house, in the presence of Bowie and Elton John. \u201cShe wore glitter herself, and one day she put glitter on Marc. David was there and said, \u2018I want some\u2019, and [Elton] had some too. So the birth of glam rock was definitely at Chelita\u2019s.\u201d|In any case, rock and popular culture would never be the same. Far from being a mere twopenny prince in Persian gloves, as he described himself in Hot Love, Bolan had become the progenitor \u2013 and king \u2013 of glam. \u201cOh man, I need TV when I\u2019ve got T. Rex!\u201d Bowie would later exclaim in his song|All the Young Dudes|.|For the next couple years or so, \u201cT. Rextasy\u201d was all the rage in Britain. In his sparkly lam\u00e9 and plush, leopard-print blazers, feather boas, top hats and mary-jane shoes \u2013 not to mention generous helpings of mascara, eyeshadow and powder \u2013 Bolan belted out hit after catchy hit, looking exquisite.|Satin and tat: Bolan in London in the mid 70s.|Photograph: MARKA/Alamy|\u201cSatin suits and boas and the Anello and Davide mary janes were|his|look\u201d, says designer Anna Sui, who described Bolan as a \u201cperennial\u201d style inspiration. Biba\u2019s founder, Barbara Hulanicki, remembers a sequinned rainbow blazer of hers that Bolan wore in a number of photographs: \u201cHe was small. I have a feeling it came off the girls\u2019 floor. Oh, he looked so amazing in that jacket.\u201d|He also looked conspicuously androgynous for the era, a quality that the writer Simon Reynolds says was one of the things that defined Bolan. Before Bowie\u2019s sexually ambiguous incarnation as Ziggy Stardust or Brian Eno\u2019s colourful gender-bending in Roxy Music, Bolan had popularised an image and attitude untypical of British male rockers. \u201cI think [my use of glitter] caused a change \u2026 especially with cosmetics,\u201d Bolan said in the BBC interview \u201cGuys could go out on stage \u2026 being not|effeminate|, but not necessarily having to have Brut aftershave on \u2013 you know, super-masculine. You could use makeup and you could use [other such] things to brighten the act.\u201d|T. Rextasy was all too brief, as was Bolan\u2019s life, which ended in 1977, when girlfriend Gloria Jones crashed into a tree exactly two weeks before his 30th birthday. Like his music, the style he pioneered continues to influence. Alongside Gucci and Saint Laurent, labels such as Hedi Slimane\u2019s Celine and Halpern have at times drawn inspiration from Bolan\u2019s preference for chunky platforms, feather boas and snakeskin prints. See also The Temples frontman James Bagshaw (a dead ringer for Bolan) and Annie Clark (AKA St Vincent), in whom echoes of Bolan can sometimes be seen, as well as even the \u201csuper-masculine\u201d Slash \u2013 who for decades has mirrored Bolan\u2019s leather top hat-and-curly mop look on the cover of his 1972 album The Slider|.|As Bolan said of his glittery Top of the Pops performance: \u201cLook what happened to the world after that!\u201d|AngelHeaded Hipster|, a tribute album featuring Mark Almond, Elton John, Nick Cave and others, is due out on BMG on 4 September|Topics|Pop and rock|David Bowie|features|Reuse this content|Most viewed|Most viewed|Fashion|Food|Recipes|Travel|Health & fitness|Women|Men|Love & sex|Beauty|Home & garden|Money|Cars|News|Opinion|Sport|Culture|Lifestyle|Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning|Sign up for our email|About us|Help|Complaints & corrections|SecureDrop|Work for us|Privacy policy|Cookie policy|Terms & conditions|Contact us|All topics|All writers|Modern Slavery Act|Digital newspaper archive|Facebook|YouTube|Instagram|LinkedIn|Twitter|Newsletters|Advertise with us|Guardian Labs|Search jobs|Patrons|Back to top|\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Then he returned to London but called me every day.|\"One day he told me his phone bill was so huge that I might as well fly over to him.|\"That's when it became different. He met me at the airport. Nothing was right.|\"My hair was a mess and I told him: 'I wanted to be beautiful for you.' He said: 'But you are.'\"|Marc bought a mansion in Richmond, Surrey, and they set up home together.|It was a long way from his roots as the son of Jewish tailor in Hackney, East London.|Growing up, despite money being scarce - his mother worked on a fruit stand in Soho - his parents had watched as their son made himself a makeshift guitar on which he tried to emulate his favourite icons, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochrane.|Later his musical destiny took shape as he hung around the famous 2 \"I\"s cafe in Old Compton Street where singers like Cliff Richard first came to fame.|By the time the family moved out to a prefab in Wimbledon, Marc's rebellious streak had resulted in his expulsion from school, he had channelled his flamboyant side into becoming a Mod, he'd had a stint modelling men's suits and swapped the \"k\" in Mark to a \"c\".|When Gloria moved in, Marc and June were not yet divorced, but he discussed marriage often with Gloria.|He told her how much he wanted children and virtually adopted her son as his own.|Rolan's birth in a Harley Street clinic made their happiness complete.|Then came the fateful night when disaster struck.|Scroll down for more...|Three-month-old Rolan with Marc and Gloria in 1976|After the last show in a music TV series Marc was hosting for Granada - where his close friend David Bowie was the final guest - Marc and Gloria went out for a meal at Morton's restaurant in Mayfair.|\"It had been a wonderfully romantic evening,\" Gloria told friends.|\"He asked me to sing for him, and I did Who Can I Turn To?

She was found lying on the bonnet and he, thrown from the car into the road, died instantly.|He had never learned to drive, always fearing he would die in a crash.|\"If he had been in a more robust car, like his Rolls-Royce,\" muses Rolan, \"he would almost certainly have survived.|\"But he'd lent the car to a friend, and given his driver the night off, so he and Gloria had to make do with the Mini.|\"There is no doubt that if they'd taken me with them that night, I would have been killed too - the seats were all crushed down into a tiny space.\"|Gloria lay in intensive care for some weeks, while Marc's parents looked after Rolan at their home.|Finally, when the doctors declared Gloria fit enough to fly, she realised she had little choice but to return to her parents' small home in California.|\"I was in need of a sanctuary,\" she said. \"And they provided it. I had lost almost everything - the great love of my life, my career [her vocal cords were wrecked by the accident], my looks, my financial security and my home.|\"But I still had Rolan - I didn't let him out of my sight for 18 years.\"|Says Rolan: \"When I was born, my father had slowed down his lifestyle because he took his responsibilities as a parent very seriously.|\"His career was not going as brilliantly as it had been, because punk was taking over, but there were still plenty of royalties coming in.|\"He wanted to provide for our future, but he found he was paying tax at 83per cent so he set up an offshore trust in the Bahamas.|\"Unfortunately, he hadn't had time to sort out all the details before he died, so there was no provision for us, and the trustees told us their hands were tied.|There was an added complication in that my father was still married to June. [She died in 1994.]|\"My mother went from a millionaire lifestyle to virtual poverty, and I often went without.|\"But even if we had money, it could never have made up for Dad not being there.|\"I don't remember being upset, but Mum tells me I often cried for him.\"|Learning that Gloria and Rolan were almost destitute, David Bowie came to the rescue.|Quietly, Bowie arranged to pay for Rolan's education in LA and settled other expenses as he was growing up. Bowie has never spoken of this.|\"The money allowed me to go to a good private school and meet children of celebrities.|\"They knew I didn't have any money, they always took me to one side and said: 'Keep your character. Stay who you are.'|\"So that has helped with motivation. For my mum, what mattered was love and the fact she was able to raise me.|\"She didn't want to go back to England and scream about the cash.\"|It was some years before it dawned on Rolan just how big a rock idol his father had been.|Since the age of six he would spend hours playing one of his father's songs, Born To Boogie, on a tiny portable record player.|It was one of the few reminders of his father - that, a gold disc and an autographed tambourine.|In 1997 he went to a screening of Marc Bolan's film, Born To Boogie, directed by Ringo Starr which showed two T.Rex concerts at Wembley Arena.|\"I had never seen him on stage before that and I had never appreciated his magnetism.|\"The film changed all that - I was blown away seeing him on screen and realising how powerful he was.|\"It was very emotional for me, of course, because I'm thinking: 'Hey, that's my dad up there.'\"|He graduated from university in LA with a degree in fine arts. Determined not to cash in on his own name, he had registered in his father's real surname, Feld.|He took a series of menial jobs, including working in a jewellery store for \u00a33 an hour.|But at the other end of the pay scale he has also modelled for Tommy Hilfiger.|Neither he nor Gloria have much in the way of mementos of Marc because after his death, there was a series of burglaries at their house.|Apart from the theft of dozens of unreleased recordings and unpublished compositions, almost all his glam rock props were taken - the latter only to emerge on eBay in the past few years.|\"I don't feel inclined to follow up the auctions in the hope of getting some of Dad's belongings back.|\"I don't have the stomach for a fight. I've had enough hassle over the estate as it is.\"|He is understandably relieved that the legal wrangles have been ironed out and that Marc's legacy is now coming through.|There is no suggestion of course that the trustees of Marc's affairs - Wizard (Bahamas) - have acted with anything less than strict regard for the legal rules.|It is only thanks to the determined efforts of Marc's record producer, Tony Visconti, that the way has finally been cleared.|He explains: \"Gloria and Marc never married, there was still a legal wife - June - in the background and Rolan suffered from archaic laws which don't allow an illegitimate child to inherit as of right.|\"The Estate of Marc Bolan stopped Rolan getting any regular payments. They were also holding up my own royalties as producer.|\"I successfully sued and it opened the gates for Rolan, because I got through. The Bolan fortune was quite a huge sum.\"|After a lengthy battle, the Trust has now arranged that Gloria and Rolan, who lives with his stepbrother, Walter Therman, can have a house from the investments in LA and that he will be given a \"controlled\" yearly allowance from the trust fund.|Marc's funeral was a hugely emotional affair, with thousands of fans sobbing as his coffin - topped by a huge floral white swan - was carried into the crematorium at Golders Green.|The tree on Barnes Common where the car crashed is a shrine permanently decked with flowers.|To commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, and his 60th birthday, there are TV documentaries, a double CD package called T.Rex - Greatest Hits and an exhibition of Bolan photos at London's Redfern Gallery.|On September 30, which would have been Marc's 60th birthday, there is to be a gala cabaret night, Bolan's Birthday Boogie, at London's Cafe de Paris which will feature a soundscape of his hits and evocative songs.|The evening will include the world premiere of A Fantasia Bolanesque, starring guest artists, including Boy George.|Rolan and Gloria Jones, and Marc's brother Harry Feld - a taxi driver - have been invited as guests of honour.|Gloria now helps run a children's orphanage in one of the poorest areas of Sierra Leone, West Africa, where she is also building the Marc Bolan School Of Music.|\"I want this time to be a celebration,\" she insists.|\"It is sad he is not here to see for himself how his music has lived on, but he was a happy person so everyone should be happy for him.|\"It is ironic that he is probably even bigger now than he was in his heyday.\"|She says she still finds it difficult to talk about the car crash.|\"I didn't come out of shock for 14 years. Marc was my soul-mate and we believed we had a great future together, which makes his death all the harder to bear.|\"There was the rock 'n' roll side to Marc, but really he was a quiet, humble boy.|\"I never saw the addictive side of him. Once Rolan was born he became a hands-on dad, and was very proud of him.\"|Says Rolan now: \"I've never tried to be like my father. Lately, I have been creating my own identity and impressing on people that they can be a fan of my father and still enjoy my music.|\"So I think any pressure I felt being 'son of Marc Bolan' has kind of gone away.\"|But after all the grief he has felt, he doesn't complain.|\"There are many times when I feel him around. Once I dreamed I was backstage at one of his shows and we talked as if we were really good friends but he didn't know I was his son.|\"Then I was in the audience and he pointed at me and he knew me. I woke up really happy.|\"Now, I go into a recording studio and I instinctively feel his spirit encouraging me, advising me.|\"If there is a problem in my life, I wonder what Dad would have done and I feel the answer coming into my head.|\"It's not as good as having him around in the flesh, but it is the next best thing.\"|Register for free to continue reading|Sign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events.|ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT?|LOG IN|Email|Please enter a valid email|Please enter a valid email|First name|Please enter a valid email|Please|Last name|2005|2004|2003|2002|2001|2000|1999|1998|1997|1996|1995|1994|1993|1992|1991|1990|1989|1988|1987|1986|1985|1984|1983|1982|1981|1980|1979|1978|1977|1976|1975|1974|1973|1972|1971|1970|1969|1968|1967|1966|1965|1964|1963|1962|1961|1960|1959|1958|1957|1956|1955|1954|1953|1952|1951|1950|1949|1948|1947|1946|1945|1944|1943|1942|1941|1940|1939|1938|1937|1936|1935|1934|1933|1932|1931|1930|1929|1928|1927|1926|1925|1924|1923|1922|1921|1920|1919|1918|1917|1916|1915|Year of birth|You must be at least 18 years old to create an account|Enter your password|Must be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number|I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.

          "|Speaking to The Independent on Sunday this weekend, Ms Aram described how she was driving just seconds behind Bolan on the ill-fated night: \"As I came over the bridge with Richard [Jones] beside me, I can still in my mind see, so clearly, a purple car which looked like a little beetle. It was upright and it was smoking and there was a tiny glimmer of light from the moon, the night was so still.\"|The \"little beetle\" was the Mini driven by Gloria Jones. Ms Aram said she didn't immediately stop at the car but drove a few metres past it.|\"I said 'we've got to get them out, this car might blow up'. I took my mother's rug from the back of my car and put it on the ground. Some of the fans are comforted by the fact he was laid on a nice lady's rug. I don't think Richard thought Marc was dead, but I knew he was. Gloria was groaning and almost conscious. But Richard cried and said 'please don't leave me'.\" In an eerie parallel with Bolan's death, Ms Aram said she crashed into a tree on the way to give evidence at Bolan's inquest a month later.|At the height of his fame in the early to mid-1970s, Bolan \u2013 born Mark Feld \u2013 outsold Jimi Hendrix and The Who with his band T Rex. But his good looks, catchy songs, air of mystique and untimely death at the age of 29 meant interest in the star has never waned.|Fee Warner, founder of the T Rex Action Group, bought the land where the sycamore tree stands to stop it from being felled. She and volunteers preserve the shrine dedicated to Bolan. Ms Warner, 53, said: \"A lot of people don't realise there was a fence between the tree and the road, because the fence was removed. When we came to build some steps, we found that when they had taken the fences away, they had taken away the ones that were undamaged, but the damaged ones had become buried on the site. That explains something which I have never been able to understand: why the damage to the tree is far higher than anything a Mini could have done.\"|Join our commenting forum|Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies|Comments|1|/|1|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|Mystery of Marc Bolan's death solved|On the 35th anniversary of the glam rock star's death in a car accident, an eyewitness reveals what happened|\u2715|Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article|Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Rex, Marc Bolan was tragically killed, like so many rock stars, far too young, in a car accident in London in 1977.|Despite his influence on the pop cultural landscape of the 1970s,|the site of Bolan's death|was never officially recognized with a memorial. However, thanks to the musician's devoted fans, a shrine has been erected that continues to grow to this day.|Advertisement|The tribute to the musician began when lovers of Bolan's music began making pilgrimages to the site where the car in which he was a passenger collided with a tree. Visitors began hanging notes and trinkets from the sycamore tree the car had hit, which eventually spread to a posting board next to it. After years of devotional offerings being placed on the \"Bolan Tree,\" the branches started to give under the weight of the love hanging from its limbs, and the tree began to die.|Since the site was never officially recognized or cared for, no one knew what to do to save the tree, until a group of ultra-devoted fans formed the awesomely named \"T. Rex Action Group.\" TAG, as it came to be known, began caring for the spot and was eventually given ownership of the land in perpetuity. The group continues to look after and improve the site to this day.|Today a stone plaque has been added in addition to a bronze bust of the flamboyant performer. Bolan's musical influence continues to live, and new fans are born every day, assuring that the site of his death will continue to accumulate devotionals for another four decades.",

          "|]|Plaque marking Bolan's childhood home, 25|Stoke Newington|Common,|Hackney|.|Bolan was born at|Hackney Hospital|and grew up at 25 Stoke Newington Common, in the borough of|Hackney|, east London, the son of Phyllis Winifred (n\u00e9e Atkins) and Simeon Feld, a lorry driver. His father was an|Ashkenazi Jew|of Russian and Polish ancestry, while his mother was of|English|descent.|[7]|[8]|Moving to|Wimbledon|, southwest London, he fell in love with the rock and roll of|Gene Vincent|,|Eddie Cochran|,|Arthur Crudup|and|Chuck Berry|and hung around coffee bars such as|the 2i's|in|Soho|.|[9]|Bolan was a pupil at Northwold Primary School, Upper Clapton. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a|skiffle|band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops\", a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old|Helen Shapiro|. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.|[10]|He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show|Orlando|, dressed as a|mod|. Bolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows.|Town|magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. When asked about his sexuality during an interview in 1975, Bolan said that he was bisexual.|[11]|Music career|[|edit|]|1964\u20131967: Early career|[|edit|]|In 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero,|Cliff Richard|, the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.|Bolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor|Allan Warren|, who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then \n-current source of inspiration,|Bob Dylan|. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.|[12]|Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"|Blowin' in the Wind|\" and|Dion|'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of|Betty Everett|'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.|Warren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul|David Kirch|, in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.|[13]|[14]|[15]|The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.|He signed to|Decca Records|in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from|James Bolam|, that it was a contraction of Bob Dylan, and \u2013 according to Bolan himself \u2013 that Decca Records chose the name.|[16]|He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with|the Ladybirds|on backing vocals (later finding fame with|Benny Hill|), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured|Jimmy Page|and|Big Jim Sullivan|, was produced by Jim Economides, with music director|Mike Leander|. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and|Donovan|. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In\", written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary|Fred Neil|, was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the|beat poets|. Neither song made the charts.|[9]|In 1966, Bolan turned up at|Simon Napier-Bell|'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album|The Beginning of Doves|). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death\", was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album|You Scare Me to Death|. Napier-Bell managed|the Yardbirds|and|John's Children|and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"|Desdemona|\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".|His tenure with the band was brief. Following an ill-fated German tour with|the Who|, Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (|The Krakenmist|and|Pictures Of Purple People|) as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth \u2013 he famously claimed to have spent time with a|wizard|in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that appeared on his first albums with|T. Rex|.|[9]|1967\u20131970: Tyrannosaurus Rex|[|edit|]|Bolan left John's Children when, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label|Track Records|. Unperturbed, he rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer|Steve Peregrin Took|and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in|Melody Maker|to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"|[9]|Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a|psychedelic|-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because Track Records had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"|[9]|The original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex with Took released three albums; two reached the top fifteen in the UK Albums Chart. They also had a top 40 hit \"Debora\" in 1968. They were supported with airplay by|BBC Radio 1|DJ|John Peel|.|[17]|One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free|Hyde Park concert|in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled|The Warlock of Love|. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969\u201370 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.|[18]|It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.|[19]|In keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white|Fender|Stratocaster|decorated with a|paisley|teardrop motif from|Syd Barrett|. After replacing Took with|Mickey Finn|, he let the electric influences come forward even further on|A Beard of Stars|, the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by|Jimi Hendrix|.|[9]|1971\u20131975: T. Rex, glam rock and other styles|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan, the pixie prince of|glam rock|, remains a huge influence in music and fashion.|\u2014|Adam Sweeting|,|The Telegraph|.|[20]|Becoming more adventurous musically, Bolan bought a modified vintage|Gibson Les Paul|guitar (featured on the cover of the album|T. Rex|), and then wrote and recorded his first hit \"|Ride a White Swan|\", which was dominated by a rolling hand-clapping back-beat, Bolan's electric guitar and Finn's percussion. At this time he also shortened the group's name to T. Rex.|[9]|Bolan and his producer|Tony Visconti|oversaw the session for \"Ride a White Swan\", the single that changed Bolan's career which was inspired in part by|Mungo Jerry|'s success with \"|In the Summertime|\", moving Bolan away from predominantly acoustic numbers to a more electric sound.|[21]|Recorded on 1 July 1970 and released later that year, it made slow progress in the|UK Top 40|, until it finally peaked in early 1971 at number two.|[22]|Inspired by his muse, June Child, Bolan developed a fascination with women's clothing, an unlikely characteristic for a British male rocker at the time.|[23]|Bolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and|T. Rex|by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist|Steve Currie|and drummer|Bill Legend|, and cutting a five-minute single, \"|Hot Love|\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"|Hey Jude|\". Bolan performed \"Hot Love\" on the BBC television show|Top of the Pops|wearing glitter on his face: the performance was later recognized as the foundation of glam rock.|[3]|[24]|For the viewers, it was a defining moment: \"Bolan was magical, but also sexually heightened and|androgynous|\".|[3]|The song was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"|Get It On|\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song, re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the US, reached No. 10 in the|Billboard|Hot 100|in early 1972.|[3]|Dressed in a satin sailor suit, but also \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 with the glittery gold teardrops beneath his eyes. This performance is often acknowledged as the birth of glam. His androgynous style has been an enduring influence on fashion. From Gucci to Saint Laurent, fashion has long drawn inspiration from his style. He knew how to subvert gender norms into fantastical new shapes.|\u2014|Joobin Bekhrad,|The Guardian|, on Bolan's March 1971 appearance on|Top of the Pops|.|[24]|In November 1971, the band's record label,|Fly|, released the|Electric Warrior|track \"|Jeepster|\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for|EMI|, who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK.|In 1972, he achieved two more UK number ones with \"|Telegram Sam|\" and \"|Metal Guru|\" taken from|The Slider|,  and two number twos in \"|Children of the Revolution|\" and \"|Solid Gold Easy Action|\".|[22]|In the same year he appeared in|Born to Boogie|, a documentary by|Ringo Starr|about T. Rex including a concert filmed at London's|Wembley Empire Pool|in March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at|John Lennon|'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and|Elton John|on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit. No T. Rex record was certified until 1985, as the record company has to pay for it, which Bolan's did not in the '70s.|[22]|Bolan took to wearing top hats and feather boas on stage as well as putting drops of glitter on each of his|cheekbones|. Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this \u2013 some say it was introduced by his|personal assistant|, Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on|Radio 1|that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then.  Other performers \u2013 and their fans \u2013 soon took up variations on the idea.|An outfit of Marc Bolan's on display at the|Hard Rock Cafe|in Sydney, Australia|The glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend|David Bowie|, whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which continued throughout his career. Bowie's 1972 song \"|All the Young Dudes|\"|name-checked|T. Rex.|[25]|Bowie's song \"|Lady Stardust|\" is generally interpreted as alluding to fellow glam rock icon Bolan. The original demo version was entitled \"He Was Alright (A Song for Marc)\"|[26]|In 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend|Jeff Lynne|on the|Electric Light Orchestra|songs \"|Ma-Ma-Ma Belle|\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from|On the Third Day|, as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.|[22]|For the following recording sessions, he recruited|soul|female singers for the backing vocals on \"|20th Century Boy|\", which peaked at number 3 in March, and mid-year \"The Groover\" which went to number four.|[22]|Tanx|, parts of which found him heading towards soul, funk and gospel, was both a commercial and critical success in several European countries. \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"|Teenage Dream|\" from the 1974 album|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow|showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend|Gloria Jones|on keyboards as well as backing vocals.|Eventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Jones, which began in July 1973. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums, putting|R & B|influences with rock on|Bolan's Zip Gun|. He was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working.|[9]|1976\u20131977: resurgence and final year|[|edit|]|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014|In September 1975 Gloria Jones gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from|tax exile|in the US and|Monaco|and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show|Supersonic|, directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, including \"New York City\" which reached the top 15. By then, Bolan was current with the music scene, incorporating disco elements in|Futuristic Dragon|and the single \"|Dreamy Lady|\". The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album,|Dandy in the Underworld|, and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along|punk|band|the Damned|as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday barely five years previously.|[9]|Later in 1977,|Granada Television|commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called|Marc|in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on|ITV|earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former|John's Children|\u2013bandmate|Andy Ellison|, then fronting the band|Radio Stars|.|[9]|Bolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival David Bowie was the final guest on the last episode of|Marc|. Bowie's solo song|\"Heroes\"|was the show's penultimate song; Bolan signed off, naming some of the musicians: \"All the cats; you know who they are\"; they then began to play a bluesy song, over the closing credits. After four words of Bowie's vocals, however, Bolan stumbled forward, and off the stage, but managed to grab the microphone, and find a smile. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.|[27]|Personal life|[|edit|]|Bolan began his first serious romantic relationship, with Teresa Whipman, in 1965.|[28]|They broke up in 1968 when Bolan met June Ellen Child. The pair immediately fell in love and moved into a flat together after only knowing each other for a few days.|[29]|They married on 30 January 1970.|[30]|She was a former secretary to his then managers,|Blackhill Enterprises|, also the managers of another of his heroes,|Syd Barrett|, whom June dated.|[31]|She was also influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.|[9]|Bolan's relationship with June was tumultuous; he engaged in several affairs over the course of their marriage, including one with singer|Marsha Hunt|in 1969, and another with artist|Barbara Nessim|while recording in America in 1971.|[32]|[33]|The couple separated in 1973, after June found out about Bolan's affair with his backing singer|Gloria Jones|.|[34]|After Bolan's death, June revealed that she had  abortions during their marriage because she believed Bolan was not mature enough to be a father.|[35]|[36]|Bolan and Gloria Jones were in a committed romantic relationship from 1973 until he died in September 1977.|[37]|The couple had a son together in September 1975 and the three of them lived together as a|nuclear family|for nearly two years until Bolan's death. At the end of June 1976, June Bolan sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery, citing Gloria Jones as the third party. At the court hearing on 5 October 1976, Deputy Judge Donald Ellison declared: \"I am satisfied that the husband committed adultery with the co-respondent, and that the wife finds it intolerable to live with him\", and granted a decree nisi. Twelve months after that date, it was to become a decree absolute thus severing the Bolans' matrimonial ties. \"The facts are that she initially left me, and we just grew apart,\" Bolan explained after the ruling. \"There were no great scenes, no smashing things up. It just suddenly happened one day. We weren't a couple anymore.\" He also used the opportunity to shed a little light on his sexuality. \"Anyway, I'm gay,\" he only half-jested. \"I can't say I was a latent homosexual \u2013 I was an early one. But sex was never a great problem. I'm a great screwer\". Asked about the institution of marriage, he replied: \"Gloria doesn't want to get married and neither do I. If I ever marry anyone again, I'll put in a clause that when it ends you're on your own \u2013 and that means financially, too.\"|[38]|Death|[|edit|]|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|at the site where he died in a car crash in|Barnes, London|on 16 September 1977, two weeks shy of what would have been his 30th birthday.|Bolan never learnt to drive, fearing a premature death.|[39]|[40]|Despite this fear, cars or automotive components are at least mentioned in, if not the subject of, many of his songs. He also owned a number of vehicles, including a white 1960s|Rolls-Royce|that was loaned by his management to the band|Hawkwind|on the night of his death.|[41]|[42]|On 16 September 1977, Bolan was a passenger in a|Mini 1275GT|driven by Gloria Jones as they headed home from Mortons club and restaurant in|Berkeley Square|. Both had been drinking wine, and after she crossed a small|humpback bridge|near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride,|Barnes|, southwest London, the car struck a fence post|[43]|and then a tree.|[44]|[45]|Bolan was killed instantly, while Jones suffered a broken arm and broken jaw.|[43]|[45]|The car crash site has become a shrine to his memory, where fans leave tributes beside the tree. In 2013, the shrine was featured on the|BBC Four|series|Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places|.|[46]|The site,|Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine|, is owned and maintained by the T. Rex Action Group.|[47]|Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Crematorium|Memorial plaque to Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium|His funeral service was held on 20 September 1977 at the|Golders Green Crematorium|in|North London|, where his ashes were later buried under a rose bush. At Bolan's funeral, attended by David Bowie,|Rod Stewart|,|Tony Visconti|and|Steve Harley|,|[48]|a swan-shaped floral tribute was displayed outside the service in recognition of his breakthrough hit single \"|Ride a White Swan|\".|There are two plaques dedicated to his memory at the Crematorium. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on\u00a0\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.|Bolan had arranged a discretionary|trust|to safeguard his money. A small, separate|Jersey|-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330\u00a0million (approx $38\u00a0\u2013 $57\u00a0million), remains in trust.|[49]|Legacy|[|edit|]|The T. Rex singer captivated generations with his strutting music and hyper-sexual charisma.|\u2014|Alexis Petridis|in|The Guardian|on \"glam's greatest icon\".|[3]|Bolan strongly influenced artists of many genres, including glam rock,|punk|,|post-punk|,|new wave|,|indie rock|,|Britpop|and|alternative rock|. After seeing Bolan wearing|Zandra Rhodes|-designed outfits,|Freddie Mercury|enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next|Queen|tour in 1974.|[50]|Bolan was the early guitar idol of|Johnny Marr|, who later found fame as the guitarist of the influential|indie rock|band|the Smiths|.|[51]|In 1979,|Siouxsie and the Banshees|released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to the single \"|The Staircase (Mystery)|\". The band had played the song live for several months and on the first anniversary of Bolan's death in 1978 played the song as the encore when they performed at Aylesbury Friars. Emerging in the|New Romantic|movement in the early 1980s,|Boy George|spoke of the impact Bolan and Bowie had on him: \"They represented a kind of bohemian existence that I \u2013 at that point \u2013 could only imagine living. I loved the music. The first time I ever saw Marc Bolan really, properly was singing 'Metal Guru' and just loved him. I don't think you can separate an artist from what they wear or what they sing \u2013 it's kind of the complete package.\"|[52]|In December 1980, \"Telegram Sam\" was the fourth single released by British gothic rock band|Bauhaus|. Also in 1980,|the Bongos|were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the|Billboard|charts with a T.Rex cover. Since then, Bongos frontman|Richard Barone|has recorded several other Bolan compositions (\"The Visit,\" \"Ballrooms of Mars\"), worked with T.Rex producer|Tony Visconti|for his current solo album,|Glow|(2010,|Bar/None Records|) that includes a remake of Bolan's \"Girl\" from|Electric Warrior|, and has himself produced tracks for Bolan's son Rolan. In 1983,|NWOBHM|band|Girlschool|covered \"20th Century Boy\" on their|Play Dirty|. In 1984,|the Replacements|released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as a B-side to the single \"|I Will Dare|\"; it is also included on the reissue version of their album|Let It Be|.|[53]|In 1985,|Duran Duran|splinter band|Power Station|, with|Robert Palmer|as vocalist, took a version of \"Get It On\" into the UK Top 40 and to US No. 6, the first cover of a Bolan song to enter the charts since his death. They also performed the tune (with|Michael Des Barres|replacing Palmer) at the|Live Aid|concert. In 1986,|Violent Femmes|covered the song \"Children of the Revolution\" on their album,|The Blind Leading the Naked|.|[54]|In 1989,|X|released a live cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to their single \"|Kurenai|\". In 1990,|Baby Ford|did a cover of \"Children of the Revolution\" that appeared on the album|Oooh, The World of Baby For|. In 1991, Japanese rock band|T-Bolan|were named after T. Rex and Bolan.|[55]|\"It felt like he actually cast a spell. I've no doubt every aspect of how he presented himself was just an outpouring of his understanding that things could be magical, things could be heightened. Out in the ordinary world, he managed to cast a spell over all of us.\"|\u2014|U2|guitarist|The Edge|on Bolan after watching him on|Top of the Pops|in March 1971.|[3]|\"|20th Century Boy|\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a|Levi's|jeans TV commercial featuring|Brad Pitt|,|[56]|and was re-released, reaching No. 13 in the UK.|[57]|The song was performed by the fictional band the Flaming Creatures (performed by|Placebo|, reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999|Brit Awards|) in the 1998 film|Velvet Goldmine|. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including|Morrissey|. In 1991, Morrissey and|David Bowie|performed a duet of \"Cosmic Dancer\" at the|Inglewood Forum|in Los Angeles.|[58]|In 1993,|Guns N' Roses|covered \"Buick MacKane\" on|\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"|,|[59]|and their guitarist|Slash|has worn a t-shirt with an image of Bolan on the front.|[20]|The main riff of|Oasis|' 1994 hit \"|Cigarettes & Alcohol|\" is lifted from \"Get It On\". In 1993,|Adam Ant|covered the track live on his|Persuasion|tour.  The song was included on a private preview show on 21 February 1993 in Burbank, Los Angeles which was recorded and released, complete with the cover version, as a live bonus CD with 1994 pressings of his|Antmusic: The Very Best of Adam Ant|collection.|[60]|[61]|The Cameron Crowe-created movie|Almost Famous|features a scene where a Black Sabbath groupie is telling aspiring journalist William Miller (said to be created in Crowe's own image) about how, \"Marc Bolan broke her heart, man. It's famous,\" regarding the character of Penny Lane, played by|Kate Hudson|.|[62]|In 2000,|Naoki Urasawa|created a Japanese|manga|entitled|20th Century Boys|that was inspired by Marc Bolan's song, \"|20th Century Boy|\". The series is a multiple award-winner, and has also been released in North America. The story was adopted into three successful live-action movies from 2008 to 2009, which were also released in the US, Canada and the UK.|[63]|In 2003,|Depeche Mode|'s|Martin Gore|recorded covers of \"Life Is Strange\" and \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\", and included them as b-sides of the single \"Stardust\".|[64]|In 2006,|Def Leppard|released their album|Yeah!|, which contains covers of their favourite bands while growing up, the first song on this album is \"20th Century Boy\".|Joe Elliott|wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while|Vivian Campbell|wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". \"|Children of the Revolution|\" was performed by|Elton John|and|Pete Doherty|of|the Libertines|at|Live 8|, in 2005.|U2|'s|Bono|and|Gavin Friday|also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the|Moulin Rouge!|soundtrack|.|[65]|[66]|In 2020,|Kesha|would also record a cover of the song along with Marc Bolan's son,|Rolan|, on backing vocals.|[67]|His music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being|Breakfast on Pluto|,|Death Proof|,|Lords of Dogtown|,|Billy Elliot|,|Jarhead|,|Moulin Rouge!|,|Herbie: Fully Loaded|,|Breaking-Up|,|Hot Fuzz|,|Click|,|School of Rock|,|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World|and|Dallas Buyers Club|.|[68]|Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence (|Joy Division|/|New Order|'s|Bernard Sumner|has said that the first single he owned was \"Ride a White Swan\".) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.|In 2007, the|English Tourist Board|included|Bolan's Rock Shrine|in their guide to Important Sites of Rock 'n Roll interest 'England Rocks'.|[69]|As reported in 2011, a school is planned in his honour, to be built in Sierra Leone: The Marc Bolan School of Music and Film.|[70]|A musical,|20th Century Boy|, based on Bolan's life, and featuring his music, premiered at the|New Wolsey Theatre|in|Ipswich|in 2011.|[71]|In September 2020 a tribute album produced by|Hal Willner|,|Angelheaded Hipster|, was released featuring covers of Bolan songs by a variety of artists including|Nick Cave|,|U2|,|Elton John|,|Joan Jett|,|Nena|and|Todd Rundgren|.|[72]|Two months later, Bolan and T.
