Moving from early folk influences and songs on the mythology of Tolkien, he transformed himself into a unique, sparkling and effervescent glam-rock icon. His boogie roots combined with Marc's own natural glitter dust, and propelled him forward on an adventure, with fortunes that were to ebb and flow over a decade. His diamond-studded halo was extinguished on 16 September 1977, at a time when his music was in the ascendancy.|The annals of history are strewn with stories of artists who passed away in shocking circumstances of those that died too young, from substance abuse, mysterious illnesses or even murder. Sometimes, the shock of their passing immediately elevates their standing in cultural memory and cements their work in a favourable light. Marc Bolan died at twenty-nine years of age, in a tragic car crash - an accident that could have been avoided. However, it took many years for people to start appreciating what Marc Bolan brought to a rock music scene in the early seventies which had stagnated in some corners after the explosion of creativity in the sixties. Yet, gradually, acclaim has grown for how he enriched the period, bringing colour and humour to an increasingly leaden genre.|Much like Hendrix before him, and Cobain after him, his natural charisma and striking beauty have underpinned his status as a dreamlike bard, an enigmatic pin-up whom boys wished they looked like and girls wished they were with. Yet it was his scorching talent as a performer and songwriter which have formed the bedrock for longevity as a legend.|Including rare and unpublished photographs, and works of Marc's own poetry, this book is put together by a true, original fan - one who followed Marc Bolan on tour, who bought every piece of vinyl he released and who was fortunate enough to have made Marc's acquaintance during the peak of his career. Published forty years on from Bolan's death,|Beautiful Dreamer|is unashamedly a book of love, a book that every Marc Bolan fan will identify with, because it paints a picture of the man that the fans idolised, worshipped and continue to cherish to this day.|Read more|Previous page|Print length|272 pages|Language|English|Publisher|Music Press Books|Publication date|21 Sept. 2017|Dimensions|16 x 2.5 x 24 cm|ISBN-10|1786064480|ISBN-13|978-1786064486|See all details|Next page|What do customers buy after viewing this item?|Page|1|of|1|Start over|Page 1 of 1|Previous page|Highest rated|in this set of products|This item:|Marc Bolan - Beautiful Dreamer: Beautiful Dreamer|John Bramley|4.5 out of 5 stars|77|Hardcover|9 offers from|\u00a37.21|Best Selling | Lowest Price|in this set of products|Bolan: The Rise And Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|Mark Paytress|4.4 out of 5 stars|146|Paperback|\u00a39.95|\u00a3|9|.|95|Ride a White Swan: The Lives and Death of Marc Bolan|Lesley-Ann Jones|4.3 out of 5 stars|166|Paperback|\u00a310.99|\u00a3|10|.|99|Get it as soon as|Tuesday, Jul 11|FREE Delivery on orders dispatched by Amazon over \u00a310|Only 7 left in stock (more on the way).|Next page|Product description|Book Description|Forty years after his tragic death, this homage to Marc Bolan pays tribute to one of the pioneers of the glam rock movement.|About the Author|John Bramley was born in New York in 1955 and moved to England with his parents at the age of three.

John and his wife Shan carried on the Bolan name in a time when there was no internet or mobile phones for fans to see or hear their idols. In a word there would have been no hope of ever hearing anything about Marc once he had died,but they continued  tirelessly sending out issues of Rarn magazine each month, which I for one could not wait to receive.

His boogie roots combined with Marc's own natural glitter dust, and propelled him forward on an adventure, with fortunes that were to ebb and flow over a decade. His diamond-studded halo was extinguished on 16 September 1977, at a time when his music was in the ascendancy.|The annals of history are strewn with stories of artists who passed away in shocking circumstances of those that died too young, from substance abuse, mysterious illnesses or even murder. Sometimes, the shock of their passing immediately elevates their standing in cultural memory and cements their work in a favourable light. Marc Bolan died at twenty-nine years of age, in a tragic car crash - an accident that could have been avoided. However, it took many years for people to start appreciating what Marc Bolan brought to a rock music scene in the early seventies which had stagnated in some corners after the explosion of creativity in the sixties. Yet, gradually, acclaim has grown for how he enriched the period, bringing colour and humour to an increasingly leaden genre.|Much like Hendrix before him, and Cobain after him, his natural charisma and striking beauty have underpinned his status as a dreamlike bard, an enigmatic pin-up whom boys wished they looked like and girls wished they were with. Yet it was his scorching talent as a performer and songwriter which have formed the bedrock for longevity as a legend.|Including rare and unpublished photographs, and works of Marc's own poetry, this book is put together by a true, original fan - one who followed Marc Bolan on tour, who bought every piece of vinyl he released and who was fortunate enough to have made Marc's acquaintance during the peak of his career. Published forty years on from Bolan's death,|Beautiful Dreamer|is unashamedly a book of love, a book that every Marc Bolan fan will identify with, because it paints a picture of the man that the fans idolised, worshipped and continue to cherish to this day.|Read more|Previous page|Print length|272 pages|Language|English|Publisher|Music Press Books|Publication date|21 Sept. 2017|Dimensions|16 x 2.5 x 24 cm|ISBN-10|1786064480|ISBN-13|978-1786064486|See all details|Next page|What do customers buy after viewing this item?|Page|1|of|1|Start over|Page 1 of 1|Previous page|Highest rated|in this set of products|This item:|Marc Bolan - Beautiful Dreamer: Beautiful Dreamer|John Bramley|4.5 out of 5 stars|77|Hardcover|9 offers from|\u00a37.21|Best Selling | Lowest Price|in this set of products|Bolan: The Rise And Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|Mark Paytress|4.4 out of 5 stars|146|Paperback|\u00a39.95|\u00a3|9|.|95|Ride a White Swan: The Lives and Death of Marc Bolan|Lesley-Ann Jones|4.3 out of 5 stars|166|Paperback|\u00a310.99|\u00a3|10|.|99|Get it as soon as|Tuesday, Jul 11|FREE Delivery on orders dispatched by Amazon over \u00a310|Only 7 left in stock (more on the way).|Next page|Product description|Book Description|Forty years after his tragic death, this homage to Marc Bolan pays tribute to one of the pioneers of the glam rock movement.|About the Author|John Bramley was born in New York in 1955 and moved to England with his parents at the age of three.

John and his wife Shan carried on the Bolan name in a time when there was no internet or mobile phones for fans to see or hear their idols. In a word there would have been no hope of ever hearing anything about Marc once he had died,but they continued  tirelessly sending out issues of Rarn magazine each month, which I for one could not wait to receive. I particularly liked the list of dates and venues T.Rex had played at, as you get older you forget these details.

Moving from early folk influences and songs on the mythology of Tolkien, he transformed himself into a unique, sparkling and effervescent glam-rock icon. His boogie roots combined with Marc's own natural glitter dust, and propelled him forward on an adventure, with fortunes that were to ebb and flow over a decade. His diamond-studded halo was extinguished on 16 September 1977, at a time when his music was in the ascendancy.|The annals of history are strewn with stories of artists who passed away in shocking circumstances of those that died too young, from substance abuse, mysterious illnesses or even murder. Sometimes, the shock of their passing immediately elevates their standing in cultural memory and cements their work in a favourable light. Marc Bolan died at twenty-nine years of age, in a tragic car crash - an accident that could have been avoided. However, it took many years for people to start appreciating what Marc Bolan brought to a rock music scene in the early seventies which had stagnated in some corners after the explosion of creativity in the sixties. Yet, gradually, acclaim has grown for how he enriched the period, bringing colour and humour to an increasingly leaden genre.|Much like Hendrix before him, and Cobain after him, his natural charisma and striking beauty have underpinned his status as a dreamlike bard, an enigmatic pin-up whom boys wished they looked like and girls wished they were with. Yet it was his scorching talent as a performer and songwriter which have formed the bedrock for longevity as a legend.|Including rare and unpublished photographs, and works of Marc's own poetry, this book is put together by a true, original fan - one who followed Marc Bolan on tour, who bought every piece of vinyl he released and who was fortunate enough to have made Marc's acquaintance during the peak of his career.

John and his wife Shan carried on the Bolan name in a time when there was no internet or mobile phones for fans to see or hear their idols. In a word there would have been no hope of ever hearing anything about Marc once he had died,but they continued  tirelessly sending out issues of Rarn magazine each month, which I for one could not wait to receive.

John and his wife Shan carried on the Bolan name in a time when there was no internet or mobile phones for fans to see or hear their idols. In a word there would have been no hope of ever hearing anything about Marc once he had died,but they continued  tirelessly sending out issues of Rarn magazine each month, which I for one could not wait to receive. I particularly liked the list of dates and venues T.Rex had played at, as you get older you forget these details.

He also read about poets and was captivated by a historic character Beau Brummel who he took on as a role model.|Hackney Empire|Bolan\u2019s Family Roots and cultural influences|The cosmopolitan influences he was exposed to also came because his family heritage came from diverse backgrounds Father\u2019s connections were Jewish Rusian and Polish.

Maintaining some power behind the music, whilst resurrecting Rock-and-roll.|Bolan and Glitter|It is not clear if it was an assistant or Bolan who thought of using glitter. Either way, he seems one of the first to have dabbed the glitter on his face. He used feathers, seen wearing Mary Jane ladies\u2019 shoes, or platforms, metallic glitter fabrics. He wore a big vintage-looking top hat. Iconic in many photos of him. Slash from Guns and Roses has similar hair and an iconic hat. Boland wore vivid colours such as electric peacock blues, and greens, rich mauve pinks. \u00a0Textures such as velvet, satin, fitted 70s style jackets, with flared trousers. Males wore eye makeup too, a smudgy sort of shadow, or black eyeliner.|The Melange of his predecessors|Having idols such as 50s Rock-and-roll Stars, Eddie Cochran, and Elvis, going through the mod and teddy boy and hippy experiments enabled his sound to blend that eerie nostalgia with something of the new frontiers that the 1970s bought.

Bolan became more aware of having to look and dress the part to gain social mobility, he had frequented the west end on the bus 73 route that went door to door from the home where he grew up, facing Stoke Newington Common.
