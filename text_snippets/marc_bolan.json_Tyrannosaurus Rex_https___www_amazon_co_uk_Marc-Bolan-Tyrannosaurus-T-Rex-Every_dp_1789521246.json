Rex founder Marc Bolan remains forever frozen in time as the poster boy of glam, the pop-rock genre he effectively launched with his March 1971 Top of the Pops appearance to promote 'Hot Love', the band's first number one single. To see Bolan only in this light is to view him through too narrow a focus. In John's Children he flirted with modernist art-rock. He sang folk songs of an otherworldly England in Tyrannosaurus Rex and became a teen idol while straddling the singles and album charts like a rock colossus and he also experimented with his unique brand of interstellar soul. Finally, he proclaimed himself 'the Godfather of Punk' and became its patron, touring with The Damned and giving several major new wave acts their first television exposure. This book examines all aspects of Bolan's career, from the genre-defying My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... through the transitional A Beard of Stars and T. Rex albums, the misunderstood Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow and the should-have-been comeback Futuristic Dragon. Along the way, it discusses Unicorn, the defining document of the Tyrannosaurus Rex years, and the essential T. Rex trilogy of Electric Warrior, The Slider and Tanx, arguing why they should be regarded as such.|Read more|Previous page|Part of series|On Track|Print length|160 pages|Language|English|Publisher|Sonicbond Publishing|Publication date|11 Jun. 2021|Dimensions|14.91 x 1.42 x 21.29 cm|ISBN-10|1789521246|ISBN-13|978-1789521245|See all details|Next page|Frequently bought together|This item:|Marc Bolan: Tyrannosaurus Rex and T.Rex: Every Album, Every Song (On Track)|\u00a311.75|\u00a3|11|.|75|Get it as soon as|Wednesday, Jul 12|Only 2 left in stock (more on the way).|Sent from and sold by Amazon.|+|Kate Bush On Track: Every Album, Every Song (On Track)|\u00a311.75|\u00a3|11|.|75|Get it as soon as|Tuesday, Jul 11|Only 8 left in stock (more on the way).|Sent from and sold by Amazon.|+|Elvis Costello And The Attractions: Every Album, Every Song (On Track)|\u00a311.75|\u00a3|11|.|75|Get it as soon as|Tuesday, Jul 11|In stock.|Sent from and sold by Amazon.|Total price:|To see our price, add these items to your basket.|Try again!|Details|Added to Basket|Add all three to Basket|Some of these items are dispatched sooner than the others.|Show details|Hide details|Choose items to buy together.|Customers who viewed this item also viewed|Page|1|of|1|Start over|Page 1 of 1|Previous page|Marc Bolan & T.

This well-written , knowledgeable and entertaining book by Peter Gallagher is a good read which adds to books by Mark Paytress, Paul Roland and Lesley Anne Jones in creating a less one-dimensional portrait of Bolan as Britain's greatest pop star. Good to read straight through or to use as a reference book. I disagreed with many of Peter Gallagher's views - which is not suprising with someone as idiosyncratic and strange as Bolan -  but his opinions are always backed by a genuine appreciation for his music with research to back them up. I disagree  with what he says about 'Prophets, Seers and Sages', which I consider the best Tyrannosaurus Rex album, and Dandy In The Underworld but this is his book and an important one for people who want to learn more about a one-off star who almost single-handedly changed rock music for ever.|Read more|2 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|meganfleurphillips|5.0 out of 5 stars|Loved it - but I wanted more :-)|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2021|Verified Purchase|Every book about Marc is a bonus - this is excellent and each song is well reviewed but (and there is always a but with books about Marc and his music) I had hoped for more. I hoped for a little more \u201cmusicality\u201d - like the intro to Midnight recorded a full step down while the rest of the song is normal tuning - the strange resolve chord in Ballrooms of Mars - you know, that kind of thing. However, the opening to the book had me \u201chook line and sinker\u201d so a valiant effort from a real fan - about time someone had a real go at Marc\u2019s songs. By the way - \u201che learned his songs from the cosmic throngs and played them on a Fender guitar\u201d is the greatest line from any song ever - period!!!|Read more|10 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|Mr. Phil  Secretan|5.0 out of 5 stars|A Very Thorough review of every Marc Bolan, Tyrannosaurus Rex and T Rex track ever recorded.|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2021|Verified Purchase|This is a very well written overview and appraisal of all of Marc Bolan`s recorded works from The Toby Tyler days, through Marc Bolan Solo, John`s Children, Tyrannosaurus Rex and T.Rex.  The author is obviously a big fan but he gives criticism where its due. I thought he was a bit harsh on the second Tyrannosaurus Rex L.P. Prophets Seers and Sages, The Angel of The Ages. and Dandy In The Underworld, T Rex`s last album.|Every track is well reviewed in microscopic detail. In summary , a well written book which sheds light on each track of Marc`s career before it was so tragically cut short in 1977.|Read more|4 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|Stephen Lloyd|VINE VOICE|5.0 out of 5 stars|Worthy addition of literature promoting the Bolan cause!|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 June 2021|Verified Purchase|Great book which I have to confess is far better written than anticipated.|I do not always agree with the authors views or comments but his narrative is both sound and in some examples persuasive.|It pains me a little that some of the quoted lyrics are inaccurate but this is a minor point and occurs infrequently enough to negate warranting the removal of a star.|Overall I loved it.

Of course, their prejudice both pro and con are bound to show up. A better idea, I think, would be to get several peoples opinions on the same songs or albums. Even better a debate in written form. The book is worth getting though even if you don\u2019t agree with everything in it. More one mans opinion on the songs of Marc Bolan than an unbiased overview of his songwriting. He hates certain periods and dons't hold back from letting the reader know.|Read more|2 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|See all reviews|Your recently viewed items and featured recommendations|\u203a|View or edit your browsing history|After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.|Your recently viewed items and featured recommendations|\u203a|View or edit your browsing history|After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.|Back to top|Get to Know Us|Careers|About Us|UK Modern Slavery Statement|Sustainability|Amazon Science|Make Money with Us|Sell on Amazon|Sell on Amazon Business|Sell on Amazon Handmade|Sell on Amazon Launchpad|Protect and build your brand|Associates Programme|Fulfilment by Amazon|Seller Fulfilled Prime|Advertise Your Products|Independently Publish with Us|Amazon Pay|Host an Amazon Hub|\u203a|See More Make Money with Us|Amazon Payment Methods|Amazon Platinum Mastercard|Amazon Classic Mastercard|Amazon Money Store|Gift Cards|Amazon Currency Converter|Payment Methods Help|Shop with Points|Top Up Your Account|Top Up Your Account in Store|Let Us Help You|COVID-19 and Amazon|Track Packages or View Orders|Delivery Rates & Policies|Amazon Prime|Returns & Replacements|Recycling|Manage Your Content and Devices|Amazon Mobile App|Customer Service|Accessibility|Australia|Brazil|Canada|China|France|Germany|India|Italy|Japan|Mexico|Netherlands|Poland|Singapore|Spain|Turkey|United Arab Emirates|United States|Amazon Music|Stream millions|of songs|AbeBooks|Books, art|& collectables|ACX|Audiobook Publishing|Made Easy|Amazon Web Services|Scalable Cloud|Computing Services|Audible|Download Audiobooks|Book Depository|Books With Free|Delivery Worldwide|DPReview|Digital|Photography|Goodreads|Book reviews|& recommendations|Amazon Home Services|Experienced pros|Happiness Guarantee|IMDb|Movies, TV|& Celebrities|Kindle Direct Publishing|Indie Digital & Print Publishing|Made Easy|Shopbop|Designer|Fashion Brands|Amazon Warehouse|Deep Discounts|Open-Box Products|Amazon Business|Service for|business customers|Whole Foods Market|We Believe in|Real Food|Conditions of Use & Sale|Privacy Notice|Cookies Notice|Interest-Based Ads Notice|\u00a9 1996-2022, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates",

Rex founder Marc Bolan remains forever frozen in time as the poster boy of glam, the pop-rock genre he effectively launched with his March 1971 Top of the Pops appearance to promote 'Hot Love', the band's first number one single. To see Bolan only in this light is to view him through too narrow a focus. In John's Children he flirted with modernist art-rock. He sang folk songs of an otherworldly England in Tyrannosaurus Rex and became a teen idol while straddling the singles and album charts like a rock colossus and he also experimented with his unique brand of interstellar soul. Finally, he proclaimed himself 'the Godfather of Punk' and became its patron, touring with The Damned and giving several major new wave acts their first television exposure. This book examines all aspects of Bolan's career, from the genre-defying My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... through the transitional A Beard of Stars and T. Rex albums, the misunderstood Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow and the should-have-been comeback Futuristic Dragon. Along the way, it discusses Unicorn, the defining document of the Tyrannosaurus Rex years, and the essential T. Rex trilogy of Electric Warrior, The Slider and Tanx, arguing why they should be regarded as such.|Read more|Previous page|Part of series|On Track|Print length|160 pages|Language|English|Publisher|Sonicbond Publishing|Publication date|11 Jun. 2021|Dimensions|14.91 x 1.42 x 21.29 cm|ISBN-10|1789521246|ISBN-13|978-1789521245|See all details|Next page|Frequently bought together|This item:|Marc Bolan: Tyrannosaurus Rex and T.Rex: Every Album, Every Song (On Track)|\u00a311.75|\u00a3|11|.|75|Get it as soon as|Wednesday, Jul 12|Only 2 left in stock (more on the way).|Sent from and sold by Amazon.|+|Kate Bush On Track: Every Album, Every Song (On Track)|\u00a311.75|\u00a3|11|.|75|Get it as soon as|Tuesday, Jul 11|Only 8 left in stock (more on the way).|Sent from and sold by Amazon.|+|Elvis Costello And The Attractions: Every Album, Every Song (On Track)|\u00a311.75|\u00a3|11|.|75|Get it as soon as|Tuesday, Jul 11|In stock.|Sent from and sold by Amazon.|Total price:|To see our price, add these items to your basket.|Try again!|Details|Added to Basket|Add all three to Basket|Some of these items are dispatched sooner than the others.|Show details|Hide details|Choose items to buy together.|Customers who viewed this item also viewed|Page|1|of|1|Start over|Page 1 of 1|Previous page|Marc Bolan & T.

Music choices is always going to be contentious, with people preferring one track to another, but that's the joy of music \ud83d\ude0a. A really worthy book for any Marc Bolan fan to own.|Read more|Helpful|Report|david oconnor|4.0 out of 5 stars|Very informative|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2023|Verified Purchase|This book helps to put into perspective all of Marc's recorded output and is a must for anybody who is a fan and collector of T.Rex.|Read more|Helpful|Report|Mike Feld|4.0 out of 5 stars|Good and detailed overview of Marc Bolan through virtually every song he released|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2021|Verified Purchase|The undeniably brilliant Marc Bolan, who  moved from Dylan wannabe to self proclaimed Godfather of Punk rock, as well as being the creator of  Glam Rock and a late 60s acid folk pioneer, was misunderstood, underrated and trashed by much of the music establishment who, during his life time, mistakenly though he was a shallow pin-up for  school aged girls and boys . This well-written , knowledgeable and entertaining book by Peter Gallagher is a good read which adds to books by Mark Paytress, Paul Roland and Lesley Anne Jones in creating a less one-dimensional portrait of Bolan as Britain's greatest pop star. Good to read straight through or to use as a reference book. I disagreed with many of Peter Gallagher's views - which is not suprising with someone as idiosyncratic and strange as Bolan -  but his opinions are always backed by a genuine appreciation for his music with research to back them up. I disagree  with what he says about 'Prophets, Seers and Sages', which I consider the best Tyrannosaurus Rex album, and Dandy In The Underworld but this is his book and an important one for people who want to learn more about a one-off star who almost single-handedly changed rock music for ever.|Read more|2 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|meganfleurphillips|5.0 out of 5 stars|Loved it - but I wanted more :-)|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2021|Verified Purchase|Every book about Marc is a bonus - this is excellent and each song is well reviewed but (and there is always a but with books about Marc and his music) I had hoped for more. I hoped for a little more \u201cmusicality\u201d - like the intro to Midnight recorded a full step down while the rest of the song is normal tuning - the strange resolve chord in Ballrooms of Mars - you know, that kind of thing. However, the opening to the book had me \u201chook line and sinker\u201d so a valiant effort from a real fan - about time someone had a real go at Marc\u2019s songs. By the way - \u201che learned his songs from the cosmic throngs and played them on a Fender guitar\u201d is the greatest line from any song ever - period!!!|Read more|10 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|Mr. Phil  Secretan|5.0 out of 5 stars|A Very Thorough review of every Marc Bolan, Tyrannosaurus Rex and T Rex track ever recorded.|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2021|Verified Purchase|This is a very well written overview and appraisal of all of Marc Bolan`s recorded works from The Toby Tyler days, through Marc Bolan Solo, John`s Children, Tyrannosaurus Rex and T.Rex.  The author is obviously a big fan but he gives criticism where its due. I thought he was a bit harsh on the second Tyrannosaurus Rex L.P. Prophets Seers and Sages, The Angel of The Ages. and Dandy In The Underworld, T Rex`s last album.|Every track is well reviewed in microscopic detail. In summary , a well written book which sheds light on each track of Marc`s career before it was so tragically cut short in 1977.|Read more|4 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|Stephen Lloyd|VINE VOICE|5.0 out of 5 stars|Worthy addition of literature promoting the Bolan cause!|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 June 2021|Verified Purchase|Great book which I have to confess is far better written than anticipated.|I do not always agree with the authors views or comments but his narrative is both sound and in some examples persuasive.|It pains me a little that some of the quoted lyrics are inaccurate but this is a minor point and occurs infrequently enough to negate warranting the removal of a star.|Overall I loved it. Some new insights and perspectives written with warmth and humour. Importantly I suspect this book could influence the casual reader to explore Bolan\u2019s largely unrecognised genius more fully.|BUY IT !|Read more|16 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|Mike Hayes|3.0 out of 5 stars|comprehensive analysis|Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2021|Verified Purchase|Quite a well written book with very comprehensive details of all Marc's releases.

Of course, their prejudice both pro and con are bound to show up. A better idea, I think, would be to get several peoples opinions on the same songs or albums. Even better a debate in written form. The book is worth getting though even if you don\u2019t agree with everything in it. More one mans opinion on the songs of Marc Bolan than an unbiased overview of his songwriting. He hates certain periods and dons't hold back from letting the reader know.|Read more|2 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report|See all reviews|Your recently viewed items and featured recommendations|\u203a|View or edit your browsing history|After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.|Your recently viewed items and featured recommendations|\u203a|View or edit your browsing history|After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.|Back to top|Get to Know Us|Careers|About Us|UK Modern Slavery Statement|Sustainability|Amazon Science|Make Money with Us|Sell on Amazon|Sell on Amazon Business|Sell on Amazon Handmade|Sell on Amazon Launchpad|Protect and build your brand|Associates Programme|Fulfilment by Amazon|Seller Fulfilled Prime|Advertise Your Products|Independently Publish with Us|Amazon Pay|Host an Amazon Hub|\u203a|See More Make Money with Us|Amazon Payment Methods|Amazon Platinum Mastercard|Amazon Classic Mastercard|Amazon Money Store|Gift Cards|Amazon Currency Converter|Payment Methods Help|Shop with Points|Top Up Your Account|Top Up Your Account in Store|Let Us Help You|COVID-19 and Amazon|Track Packages or View Orders|Delivery Rates & Policies|Amazon Prime|Returns & Replacements|Recycling|Manage Your Content and Devices|Amazon Mobile App|Customer Service|Accessibility|Australia|Brazil|Canada|China|France|Germany|India|Italy|Japan|Mexico|Netherlands|Poland|Singapore|Spain|Turkey|United Arab Emirates|United States|Amazon Music|Stream millions|of songs|AbeBooks|Books, art|& collectables|ACX|Audiobook Publishing|Made Easy|Amazon Web Services|Scalable Cloud|Computing Services|Audible|Download Audiobooks|Book Depository|Books With Free|Delivery Worldwide|DPReview|Digital|Photography|Goodreads|Book reviews|& recommendations|Amazon Home Services|Experienced pros|Happiness Guarantee|IMDb|Movies, TV|& Celebrities|Kindle Direct Publishing|Indie Digital & Print Publishing|Made Easy|Shopbop|Designer|Fashion Brands|Amazon Warehouse|Deep Discounts|Open-Box Products|Amazon Business|Service for|business customers|Whole Foods Market|We Believe in|Real Food|Conditions of Use & Sale|Privacy Notice|Cookies Notice|Interest-Based Ads Notice|\u00a9 1996-2022, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates"
