Pubs and venues across the city are hosting nights in tribute to the electric warrior himself \u2013 but it all began right here in Hackney.|Born Mark Feld (it would be 10 years until he changed his name to Marc Bolan) on 30 September 1947 in Hackney General Hospital, Mark spent his childhood living at 25 Stoke Newington Common with his mother Phyllis, dad Simeon and brother Harry. In 1947, Stoke Newington was only just recovering from the effects of WW2 and was hardly the place anyone would expect a man who would come to reinvent the word flamboyant to be brought up.|Mark and his brother attended|Northwold School|, where he was to form his first group, a skiffle band, at the age of nine. Bolan also played guitar in Susie and the Hula Hoops during his time at Northwold, an experience he obviously felt was important to his success, often mentioning it during interviews at the height of his fame.|Northwold Primary School.

          "|It was in his Stoke Newington abode, where Mark was to be exposed to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll for the first time, that he had been initially disappointed when his dad brought home Bill Haley\u2019s \u2018Rock Around The Clock\u2019 (instead of the Bill Hayes record he had asked for). As the needle hit the groove, however, almost instantly he was converted, later claiming \u201cjust one play of that and I chucked Bill Hayes out of the window\u201d.",
          "|His new found love would bring him to the Hackney Empire, where he would go to watch recordings of the television music programme Oh Boy. It was at the Empire where 13 year old Mark was to meet his hero, Eddie Cochrane, who allowed him to carry his guitar out to the awaiting limousine after the show.",
          "|Once Mark became Marc he wasted no time paying tribute to his hero, having his Les Paul refinished in orange to pay homage to the guitar he carried out of the Empire at the age of 13, and also regularly covering \u2018Summertime Blues\u2019.",
          "|Before creating the movement that came to define the early 70s, Mark was busy helping to build the foundations of a much earlier one, the mods. Mark joined a modelling agency, and was shown in a photo shoot for Town magazine as a perfect example of the Mod movement that was sweeping across Stamford Hill and around Britain.",
          "|At the age of 15 Mark left William Wordsworth Secondary School, and Hackney all together, moving to Wimbledon."
