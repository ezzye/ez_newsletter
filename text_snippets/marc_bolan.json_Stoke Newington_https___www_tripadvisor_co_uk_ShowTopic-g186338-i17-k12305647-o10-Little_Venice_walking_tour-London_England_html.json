Compared to Borough or Portobello Market, I think this one is lower on my list. It has some great good options and the vendors for jewelry and clothing are fun, they are quite pricey. You likely won't find many \"bargains\", but it's fun to spend hours just navigating the different store fronts. Please know that it is VERY hard to social distance here even though you are outside as one might expect, so wear a mask if you are concerned. Also, you may want to put time aside to roam this area of the city before/after as well, because it's really fun and hip!|Read more|Visited|July 2022|Written|5 July 2022|FLnurseER|Boca Raton, Florida|2,674 contributions|Pretty crowded, but fun|One of the most crowded places we have been to in the 3 weeks we have been visiting major London attractions. Lots of fun though, geared mainly towards younger aged clientele. many merchants in the food section were offering tasters, by the time I sampled them, I was not even hungry. We then walked through the nearby streets, colorful, decorated with graffiti and other crazy decor, bought some reasonably priced souvenirs.

We were in the area called the STalls (close to the Chalk Farm Road Tube station, not the Camden market station).  We had a fabulous lunch at the M'eat the Vegan Resatuant there.  One of our party is vegan so we decided to \"spoil\" here and we all ate vegan.  It was delicious.  The boys had tacos, we had \"fish\" and chips and a huge delicious salad.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  then we went to severla store.  The best was \"Psylo\" Fashion, store #49.  The two salesladies were exremely helpful, the clothese are just fabulous and our boys were able to get really special clothes.

For quite some time, locals and out-of-towners alike have loved browsing the boutiques of Bermondsey High Street, foraging through the bounteous stalls at centuries old foodie haven Borough Market, and flocking to the banks of the Thames to enjoy some of Britain's biggest attractions such as Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe. Despite Southwark's many popular draws, instant calm can be achieved easily by turning down almost any side street. For more urban buzz, a quick stroll across famed bridges like the pedestrianized Millennium Bridge or the ever photogenic Tower Bridge yields access to the very core of Central London. And with London Bridge Station as this neighbourhood's main transportation hub, getting across town (or to anywhere in England for that matter) is a relative breeze.|Read more|How to get there|London Bridge \u2022 5 min walk|Monument \u2022 8 min walk|Full view|Best nearby|We rank these restaurants and attractions by balancing reviews from our members with how close they are to this location.|Restaurants|9,590 within 3 miles|The Bermondsey Bierkeller|146|0.1 mi|American \u2022 German \u2022 Pizza \u2022 Beer restaurants|Mallow|235|271 ft|\u00a3 \u2022 International \u2022 Vegan Options|Boro Bistro|1,057|422 ft|\u00a3\u00a3 - \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 \u2022 French \u2022 Bar \u2022 European|Lord Clyde Southwark|195|0.3 mi|\u00a3 \u2022 Bar \u2022 British \u2022 Pub|Monmouth Coffee Company|632|210 ft|\u00a3\u00a3 - \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 \u2022 Quick Bites \u2022 Cafe|Silka|487|236 ft|\u00a3\u00a3 - \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 \u2022 Indian \u2022 Vegetarian Friendly \u2022 Vegan Options|Honest Burgers - Borough|429|397 ft|\u00a3\u00a3 - \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 \u2022 American \u2022 British \u2022 Vegetarian Friendly|TwoRuba Bar|283|0.3 mi|\u00a3\u00a3 - \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 \u2022 Bar \u2022 Vegetarian Friendly|Maria's Market Cafe|310|90 ft|\u00a3 \u2022 Quick Bites \u2022 Cafe \u2022 British|Whiskey Ginger|370|235 ft|\u00a3 \u2022 Bar \u2022 British \u2022 Vegetarian Friendly|See all|Attractions|2,274 within 6 miles|Old Operating Theatre Museum and Herb Garret|797|491 ft|Historic Sites \u2022 Educational sites|Southwark Cathedral|916|253 ft|Religious Sites \u2022 Churches & Cathedrals|Golden Hinde|579|513 ft|Speciality Museums \u2022 Points of Interest & Landmarks|Clink Prison Museum|1,791|0.1 mi|Speciality Museums|Winchester Palace|75|527 ft|Historic Sites \u2022 Ancient Ruins|The View from The Shard|19,258|0.2 mi|Points of Interest & Landmarks \u2022 Architectural Buildings|Southwark War Memorial|2|0.1 mi|Points of Interest & Landmarks \u2022 Monuments & Statues|Minerva House|2|492 ft|Architectural Buildings|Menier Chocolate Factory|286|0.2 mi|Theatres|The Shard|1,019|0.2 mi|Architectural Buildings|See all|See what other travellers are saying|Learn more|Lola C|15 contributions|\"Fantastic sampling exploration of culture\"|Despite it being my second time visiting Borough Market, the experience was equally splendid as my initial attendance. My father and I went on a Monday afternoon and although it was less busy than our first Friday encounter; the atmosphere still buzzed with the hustle and bustle of those around us. From hot dishes like paella and curries, to a plethora of freshly baked cakes to satisfy any sweet tooth; there were plenty of opportunities to try something unfamiliar to our routine meal deals. \nAfter queuing for around twenty minutes for a lovely little stall selling bagels, we both tucked into a rather generous salt beef bagel, complete with mustard and gherkins. However, it is worthy to note that the prices are higher than those from your typical supermarket, yet perfectly justifiable; I must admit it was both refreshing and pleasing to have the opportunity to support small businesses during these difficult times. \nThe local businessmen were all polite and friendly; keen to engage in trivial small talk despite the stress of sometimes single-handedly operating their stalls. I revisited a stall selling fresh olives and the lady was more than willing to permit me to try a mouth-watering chilli and garlic olive before making my selection. She was even accommodating to my father who struggled with the flavour of the heavily laden chilli olive and gave him some humus to soothe the burn. \nI will definitely be returning to this delightful market and should I ever find myself working in the local area in the years to come, I would not be surprised if I became a regular customer to these stalls!\nHighly and happily recommended.|Read more|Visited|August 2022|Written|23 August 2022|hmthompson6055|Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|39 contributions|Saturday visit to the market|The market was a great stop if you enjoy delicious food.

It's within a stone's throw of London Bridge and other sites.   It can be a little deceiving though. There is the main section but then there are two other sections that are harder to get to.  Always best to note where the queues are for food.  And I would recommend NOT going during peak times on Saturday's  from 11am onwards..  Go early to beat the crowds...

This place sells lots of cooked food as well as fresh produce like fruits, vegetables, meat and seafood. They also sell cheese, chocolates, pastries, bread, flowers, handicraft and lots more. The doughnuts are to die for!!! Go for the vanilla cream and also the chocolate doughnuts, you will not regret it! I also bought the biggest fresh oyster that I have ever seen, over here, for 10 British pounds and the shopkeeper shucked it for me in front of my eyes, and I gobbled it up! It was fresh and delicious!!! I also bought 1 kg of fresh cherries to bring back to my hotel for supper. The Malaysian beef rendang sold by the Joli food truck is also HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Compared to Borough or Portobello Market, I think this one is lower on my list. It has some great good options and the vendors for jewelry and clothing are fun, they are quite pricey. You likely won't find many \"bargains\", but it's fun to spend hours just navigating the different store fronts. Please know that it is VERY hard to social distance here even though you are outside as one might expect, so wear a mask if you are concerned. Also, you may want to put time aside to roam this area of the city before/after as well, because it's really fun and hip!|Read more|Visited|July 2022|Written|5 July 2022|FLnurseER|Boca Raton, Florida|2,674 contributions|Pretty crowded, but fun|One of the most crowded places we have been to in the 3 weeks we have been visiting major London attractions. Lots of fun though, geared mainly towards younger aged clientele. many merchants in the food section were offering tasters, by the time I sampled them, I was not even hungry. We then walked through the nearby streets, colorful, decorated with graffiti and other crazy decor, bought some reasonably priced souvenirs.

I am not one for grunge and funky styles but the market has a cool atmosphere and worth a browse.  There are some boutique arts and crafts, as well as jewellery and not to mention the food!  Best to do when it isn't raining.  Parts of the market are covered but still try and do it on a dry day.  Saturday is the best day.  Mind bags as sometimes there are a few stray characters but nothing unsafe.  Not the cleanest especially outside but fine otherwise.|Read more|Written 1 July 2023|This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
