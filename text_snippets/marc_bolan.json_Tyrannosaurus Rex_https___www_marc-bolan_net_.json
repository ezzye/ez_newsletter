          "|Although undertaking PhD research Fee Warner spent most of 1999 (from TAG's formation) designing, making and selling items such as T-Shirts, Bookmarcs and Badges to help pay for the project. She was helped by husband Kevin Warner and by both their children Rohan Marc (then aged eighteen) and Oscar (aged just Nine to Ten years old in 1999). Donations for the project came from many fans abroad.|1999 AUCTION:|In addition to producing items directly for sale some were specifically designed, and produced for an auction. Sadly, this was in the days before eBay had 'caught on' so only those in the room were generally able to bid which resulted in lower than hoped for prices. In September 1999, TAG|TM|held the auction of items including prints produced by TAG and signed by photographer Peter Sanders and artist George Underwood. Many tanx to Jim Ryder for arranging for them to be signed, although disappointingly many sold for around \u00a310.00 each as the UK fans present were hoping for bargains and several people even tried to haggle over the price of set price items such as T-Shirts :-(|KEY AUCTION SALE ITEMS:|Two sets of framed contact prints, negatives and enlargements|were prepared, paid for by Fee Warner and donated to the auction to raise funds. These sold for over \u00a3300.00. The negatives were previously unpublished and were sold with copyright, having been gifted to Fee on one of her many visits to Marc Bolan's parents in 1977/78. Marc's mum disliked 'The Tree' wrongly blaming it for his death, however Marc's older brother Harry gave his approval for the project. Family approval was something, which Fee felt, was essential for this work to happen. The donation of these photographs was her way of returning to Marc something given to her by his mother Phyllis. Fee turned down the offer of Marc's clothing suggesting to Phyllis that she saved it for when Rolan was older. In that respect, Marc's mum was far too generous. Some years later one fan and her husband, who were gifted a jacket AND another item of clothing (as they weren't married at the time) refused to allow one of those items to be displayed behind glass and fully insured in a Museum so that all visitors to the museum would have been able to see it.|2000 - TAG LAID THE STEPS:|from the PRS Memorial to the 'Bolan Tree' with a viewing platform around the tree so visitors do not risk injury by standing on the pavement less & narrow road by the tree. TAG has also erected a notice board for messages & crucially|saved the 'Bolan Tree' from felling.|All this was achieved within four months of TAG receiving the Lease, although work to fund raise and deal with the 'red tape' meant that the key members of TAG had been working for TAG for a full year by the time the Tree was successfully saved in April, 2000.|2002 - 25th ANNIVERSARY - BRONZE BUST:|Rolan Bolan|unveiled a|Bronze Bust|of his father at the site to commemorate the|25th anniversary of Bolan's death|. This Bronze was paid for personally by Fee Warner.|2005: FIVE MEMORIAL PLAQUES|TAG once again sold fund raisers to raise the money needed to install plaques for the four members of T-Rex who like Marc, have passed over. They are:|Steve Peregrin Took|;|Steve Currie|;|Mickey Finn|&|Dino Dines|& a Memorial Plaque for|June Bolan|(nee Child) in recognition for her part in Marc's success.|2007 - 30th ANNIVERSARY:|TAG organised a Very Special & indeed Unique Event for its  Members|This was the First Ever|Marc Bolan Celebration|inside the Sacred Stone Circle of|Stonehenge|. This was part of a|Marc's Mystical Roots|trip where  Members retraced the steps of Marc and the late|John Peel|to the top of|Glastonbury Tor|, before dining in a private room at the|George and Pilgrims Inn|(the oldest Inn in the South West of England dating back to the 15th Century) before heading for the Exclusive, Private booking of Stonehenge where  Members were entertained by|Paul (T-Rex) Fenton|and|Rob Benson|of|T-Rex - A Celebration of Marc and Mickey|. A|Druid Ceremony|(|Wear a Tall Hat like the Druids|) was performed by|Stonehenge Arch Druid Rollo Maughfling|and|Hon. Glastonbury Order of Druids Arch Druidess Victoria Marsden|.|2009 - THE LAUNCH OF THE MARC BOLAN ROSE FUND:|The project to have a unique & new variety  of Rose named after Marc was launched by TAG. This is an ongoing project and it is hoped that the balance of the money needed to initiate the growing of the rose will be achieved by the end of 2012. How long it takes before the rose is on sale will depend on how quickly the rose crosses can be done to achieve the most pleasing result.|18th September 2009:|To Celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the formation of TAG as well as the 32nd Anniversary of Marc's Passing|MF's T-Rex|performed as part of a Benefit Celebration in the heart of London, at the 100 Club on Friday 18th September 2009.|2010:|Once again TAG continued to ensure the site was a suitable tribute to Marc Bolan and his band T-Rex with routine maintenance including topping up the bark chippings in the steps, replacing several of the railway sleepers which make up the steps and repainting the steps and notice board, because to main the site as though 'nothing has been done' requires work!|2011 KEEPING THE BOLAN TREE SAFE:|Pollarding the Tree which was undertaken in March, 2011 by Bob Knoakes and his team from|THE ORIGINAL TREE SURGEONS LIMITED|. Visit our Photo Galleries for Full Information with Photos and Videos.|2011 BULB PLANTING:|In late 2011 TAG will be planting a range of bulbs at the site on either side of the steps. Bulbs were planted in 1998 and TAG members Fee and Oscar Warner were two of the key people who undertook that work. However, the ground was not prepared and the bulbs were not planted correctly so that many did not achieve their potential. For this reason, the 2011 bulb planting will be accompanied by the preparation of proper 'bulb beds' because one perennial problem associated with the site is the fast drainage of the site due to the slope of the embankment. Therefore, moisture-retaining additives to the soil will be used to help with this problem.|2012:|We have planted the bulbs|*|and are delighted to say that the Marc Bolan Rose is now a reality for Marc's 35th Anniversary/Marc's 65th Birthday.|2013|The Marc Bolan Rose is now REAL and is on sale - exclusively from TAG for the UK and Europe.

These were only available 'bare rooted' which isn't ideal for those without any|green fingers|.|2015 - THE BOLAN TREE|The Key priority during the first part of 2015 was to make the site safe for visitors, passing motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.  The Bolan Tree was felled and a capping barrel was placed over the base of the Bolan Tree. On the 15th May 2015 T.Rex Action Group / TAG and the Logo were registered as Trademarks.|2016 to 2020:|Although the Bolan Tree was felled in 2015 Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine is so much more than the Tree. From the PRS Memorial unveiled in 1997, to the Memory Board and Steps added in 2000, through the Bronze Bust unveiled by Rolan Bolan in 2002 the site is Special and a place of pilgrimage to thousands of people from all over the world all-year-round.|2021:|VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE|: Saturday the 13|th|and Sunday 14|th|February 2021 saw the wholescale deversation of this \"|Very Special Corner|\"|*|of Barnes Common Conservation Area by Network Rail contractors. TAG was NOT notified. The local residents were notified that there would be  \"|cutting back overgrown vegetation that is obstructing the highway and felling dead, dying or diseased trees|\". Richmond Council permitted a road closure of Queen's Ride for that weekend for this work. The filming done by TAG shows that there was a clear need to remove the saplings which were growing on the narrow piece of land between the 'Armco crash barrier' and Queen's Ride. There is no dispute that this vegetation did need removing, as did the dead trees, However, no one knew what would be done and because it happened over a weekend it was impossible for anyone to contact Richmond Council's appropriate department to get one of their experts to visit and limit the damage. By the time Richmond Council's offices opened again on Monday 15|th|February 2021 it was too late.|*|Quoted in Richmond Council's own '|Cconservation Area Study|- Barnes Common No. 32 and Mill Hill No. 14|' pdf.|The Valentine's Day Massacre spured TAG on to apply to become a|Community Interest Company|(|CIC|)|On the 21st December 2021 TAG was Officially Granted CIC Status|This wonderfully happened on the|Winter Solstice 2021|.

Now that TAG is Officially and Legally registered as a CIC, we can apply for funding from various organisations so that we can make Marc's Shrine a more Fitting Tribute to Marc Bolan and his band T.Rex as TAG 'Rev-Up' forwards Marc's 45th Anniversary on the 16th of September 2022 and his 50th Anniversary in 2027. This will include TAG's  new key projects.|One is to have electricity collected and having a CCTV system installed|which will live-stream Marc's Shrine around the Globe 24 hours a day, seven days a week for all the fans who cannot visit the site or cannot visit as open as they'd like to.|Part two on our agenda|is that because Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine is within the London Borough of Richmond-Upon-Thames'|Barnes Common Conservation Area'|and has been since 2002, when TAG applied for planning permission to install the Bronze Bust unveiled by Rolan Bolan at the shrine, we have a duty of care to manage the site carefully for the benefit of all - Marc Bolan and T.Rex Fans, Local Residents, the wider community of Richmond-Upon Thames, and the Worldwide fans who are now, more than ever discovering Marc Bolan through his band T.Rex's induction into the Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame in America.|Therefore, TAG will establish and implement an appropriate management system as recommended in the Richmond Council '|biodiversity action plan|'. This project will require a mains water supply to be installed so that when we start our planting programme of appropriate trees and shrubs, they will have a far better chance of thriving, because buying saplings and shrubs or a substantial size are expensive investments. Increasing the biodiversity of the Flora, will create new enriched habitats for Native Fauna species to increase in number, something which is essential as we all see a decline in our Birds, Insects and Small Mammals.|As well as the profits from our fund-raising merchandise, and periodic donations from fans our newly gained 'Community Interest Company' status will mean we can apply for funding from appropriate bodies and organisations including The Arts Council, The Lottery Fund and locally based bodies and organisation.|TAG has some other ideas 'in the pipeline' which we'll let you know about when the time is right.|2022 and Onwards|:\u00a0 2022 sees TAG|TM|CIC Celebrate our 23rd Anniversary.|On the 16th September 2022 it will be the 45th Anniversary of Marc Bolan's Spirit acending at the site.|TAG|TM|CIC has already raised some money to have a custom-made hand rail manufactured and fitted to one side of the steps to make the site safer for all visitors, especially the 'originals' who are, like Fee around or over 60-years-of-age now!

Increasing the biodiversity of the Flora, will create new enriched habitats for Native Fauna species to increase in number, something which is essential as we all see a decline in our Birds, Insects and Small Mammals.|As well as the profits from our fund-raising merchandise, and periodic donations from fans our newly gained 'Community Interest Company' status will mean we can apply for funding from appropriate bodies and organisations including The Arts Council, The Lottery Fund and locally based bodies and organisation.|TAG has some other ideas 'in the pipeline' which we'll let you know about when the time is right.|2022 and Onwards|:\u00a0 2022 sees TAG|TM|CIC Celebrate our 23rd Anniversary.|On the 16th September 2022 it will be the 45th Anniversary of Marc Bolan's Spirit acending at the site.|TAG|TM|CIC has already raised some money to have a custom-made hand rail manufactured and fitted to one side of the steps to make the site safer for all visitors, especially the 'originals' who are, like Fee around or over 60-years-of-age now!
