Bolan grew up in Stoke Newington Common, in the borough of Hackney, east London and at the age of nine, Bolan was given his first guitar and began a skiffle band. While at school, he played guitar in \u201cSusie and the Hula Hoops,\u201d a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old Helen Shapiro. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour. In 1964, Mark met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \u201cAll At Once\u201d (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, Cliff Richard, the \u201cEnglish Elvis\u201d), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven inch vinyl, after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Hall. This recording is now regarded as possibly the very first known track that the young Mark had put to professional studio tape. There are, however, claims that Marc\u2019s very first recording was with Joe Meek. This is based on a scratchy anonymous acetate disc discovered by the Joe Meek fan club, which has a definite resemblance to Marc\u2019s vocal delivery. This recording, a song called \u201cMrs Jones\u201d, is thought to date from 1963.",
