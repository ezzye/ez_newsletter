          "|Mark Twain said that success is assured for those who have both ignorance and confidence. Few could be said to embody\n    this philosophy as gloriously as T. Rex\u2019s Marc Bolan. Here was someone so convinced that he was going to be a famous\n    rock star that he all but willed it into being; forming one of the seventies\u2019 most influential acts in the process.\n    His unique and peculiar alchemy of raw talent and self-delusion - as well his ostentatious style - profoundly\n    changed what a rock musician could be. For Bolan, finding fame was not without its setbacks, but they were simply\n    beside the point. To him, it was inevitable; 'If God were to appear in my room,' he once said to a journalist,\n    'obviously I would be in awe, but I don't think I would be humble. I might cry, but I think he would dig me like\n    crazy.'",
          "|Bolan was born Mark Feld, and grew up in East London\u2019s Stoke Newington. From an early age he was entranced with music\n    and performance, and began telling anyone who would listen that he would be a star \u2018bigger than Elvis\u2019. As a kid, he\n    played in the adorably-named band Susie and the Hula Hoops with a twelve year old Helen Shapiro, and hung out after\n    school at the Hackney Empire - even carrying his idol Eddie Cochran\u2019s guitar. After being kicked out of school at\n    14, he began working as a model (despite being all of 5\u20194\u201d) and a dedicated follower of fashion. He was an early\n    adopter of mod style, even appearing not long after his expulsion on the cover of",
          "|Town Magazine|, boasting\n    of his \u2018ten suits, eight sports jackets, fifteen pairs of slacks, about twenty jumpers, three leather jackets, two\n    suede jackets, five or six pairs of shoes and thirty exceptionally good ties.'|The young Feld began recording music after changing his name (for unknown reasons) to Toby Tyler, releasing several\n    singles that sank before changing it to Mark Bowland and then again to Marc Bolan. He began writing prolifically,\n    music and his other love, fantasy literature. His biggest literary obsession was with|The Lord of the Rings|- which ironically he had never read due to his dyslexia, and he began penning novels and poetry collections with\n    titles like|The Krakenmist|and|The Warlock of Love|. After releasing several singles as both Tyler\n    and Bolan, he was invited to join mod band John\u2019s Children, and it was during his brief tenure with the outfit that\n    he caught the eye of David Bowie\u2019s producer Tony Visconti. 'I didn't see a musician,' recalled Visconti, 'I saw a\n    star. I went up to him and he said, \"Oh, you're the eighth producer I've met this week. John Lennon was in here last\n    night, and he wants to produce us.\" He was totally full of himself.' Visconti recalled that the very next day, Bolan\n    called him from across the street asking if he could audition immediately. 'He made it sound casual. \"I'm just\n    passing by, we'd like to come up and audition.\"\u2019|John\u2019s Children broke up soon after. Undeterred, Bolan reconvened under the mantle Tyrannosaurus Rex and eventually\n    managed to secure a record deal, with production duties being handled by Visconti. It a crucial partnership, and\n    after several (pretty average) folk-oriented records, it bore fruit with their first major hit - the electric,\n    groove-driven|Ride a White Swan|. This song single-handedly changed the course of their career.\n    Tyrannosaurus Rex became T. Rex and Bolan ditched the renaissance faire aesthetic for something altogether more\n    glamorous. Clad in a top, outrageously lapelled jacket and feather boa, Bolan was transformed; his rock star\n    ambitions crystallised into final shimmering reality.|Bolan\u2019s success with|Ride a White Swan|led T. Rex to a string of brilliant records - including their\n    inarguable apotheosis, 1971\u2019s|Electric Warrior -|and their a fuzzed-out wall of guitar sound, swaggering\n    rhythm section and flamboyant style came to define what \u2018glam rock\u2019 was|.|It also made Bolan a star.\n    Somewhat predictably for one who had held his own talent in such unimpeachable regard, this also could make him\n    intolerable - he began claiming that he was to star in a David Niven film, that he was selling double his reported\n    record sales, that Lennon was imitating him. DJ and promoter Jeff Dexter, who became Bolan\u2019s manager around this\n    time said that Bolan could be incredibly arrogant. \u2018People from working-class backgrounds who suddenly become famous\n    often feel they can take liberties with people; and Marc took a lot of liberties. All the sycophants were telling\n    him he was the most wonderful thing in the world and he believed it.\u2019|It couldn\u2019t last, and despite several more brilliant to pretty-good albums (including what must be a contender for\n    history\u2019s most outlandishly named album:|Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow: A Creamed Cage in\n    August|), Bolan began to slip from the charts by the mid-seventies. With much of his band rotating at a fierce\n    clip due to the difficulty of working with Bolan, and Bolan himself struggling with his weight as well as drug and\n    alcohol abuse, his career got put on hold. By 1977 he had cleaned himself up with the help of his new wife, Gloria\n    Jones, and was back to recording and even had his own TV show. Sadly it wasn\u2019t to be. His car - driven by Jones -\n    wrapped itself around a tree in southwest London on September the 16th, killing him instantly. Even today, decades\n    later, it feels like a career cut tragically short. Perhaps in some way though, it\u2019s the end that Bolan might have\n    wanted - his career and legacy forever hermetically sealed, his place in the pantheon assured, his preening,\n    strutting self-preserved perfectly for us to enjoy for all eternity.|Contributor|Ben St George|@bensaintgeorge|Read more from Ben St George|Published|November 2016|Tags|Band|icon|John Lennon|Largesse|Liberality|Marc Bolan|music|Rakish|T-Rex|Tony Visconti|Also read|America's Godfather: Robert De Niro|Party Animals: The Rothschild Surrealist Ball|The Forgotten Prince|Newsletter|Subscribe|By signing up for the newsletter you agree with our|Terms and conditions|About The Rake|Follow us|Magazine|\u00a9 2023 The Rake|GBP",
