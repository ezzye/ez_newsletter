# "Marc Bolan: London's First Glam-Rock Star"

Marc Bolan, born as Mark Feld, was a beacon of light in the world of music. Born on 30th September 1947, in a humble home at 25a Stoke Newington Common, he would go on to become one of the most recognizable stars in British rock music.

His journey began in Stoke Newington, where he lived with his mother, Phyllis, who worked at a Soho fruit stall, and his father, Simeon, a lorry driver. His early life was quite ordinary, with him assisting his mother at the fruit stall and his father making a living as a lorry driver.

His passion for music was evident from a young age, and by the time he was attending Northwold School, he was already playing guitar in a group "Susie and the Hoops" alongside 12-year old vocalist Helen Shapiro.

He left school as soon as he could in 1962 and around the same time moved from his Stoke Newington Common home. He briefly joined a modelling agency and became a "John Temple Boy," appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store.

Bolan had a knack for reinventing himself, with his first stage name being Toby Tyler, inspired by a film of the same name, before he finally settled for Marc Bolan. The name Bolan was cleverly derived from the first two and last three letters of his hero Bo(b) (Dy)lan.


He is best known as the founder of the British rock band Tyrannosaurus Rex, which was later abbreviated to T. Rex. His music, as well as his highly original sense of style and extraordinary stage presence, helped create the glam rock era.

But even the brightest stars must eventually dim. Marc spent his last night in Morton's bar and restaurant at Berkeley Square, along with his girlfriend Gloria Jones. Tragically, he never took a driving test or had a licence. He died instantly when Jones lost control of the car, and it struck a sycamore tree after failing to negotiate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, in South West London at 5 a.m. on 16 September 1977.
