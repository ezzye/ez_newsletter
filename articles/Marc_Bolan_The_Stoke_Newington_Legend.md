# "Marc Bolan: The Stoke Newington Legend"

## "Unveiling the Plaque for Marc Bolan in Tooting"

Marc Bolan, a monumental figure in the music industry, known for founding and leading the psychedelic folk group T. Rex, spent a significant part of his life in Stoke Newington. Born as Mark Feld, Bolan moved to Summerstown at the age of 13 when his family relocated from Stoke Newington in 1961. It was in this area where he immersed himself in poetry and began busking, setting the foundation for his future musical career. Outside the Prince of Wales pub, now a Tesco Express, young Bolan would practice his craft and prepare for the stardom that was to come.


T. Rex, under Bolan's leadership, produced classics such as "Get it On," "Children Of The Revolution," and "I love to Boogie." Bolan's influence reached far and wide, making him one of the biggest pop stars of his generation. Tragically, he died after a car crash in Barnes, two weeks shy of his 30th birthday.


In commemoration of the time Bolan spent in the area, a plaque is set to be unveiled in Tooting. Geoff Simmons, the founder of the Summerstown 182 Community History Project, recently posted a picture of the plaque on his [Twitter page](https://twitter.com). The unveiling of this plaque will serve as a fitting tribute to the rock star who left an indelible mark on the music industry and the Stoke Newington community.
