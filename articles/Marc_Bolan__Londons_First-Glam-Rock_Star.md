Born as Mark Feld in Stoke Newington on September 30, 1947, Marc Bolan lived there until 1962 with his parents. His mother, Phyllis, worked on a Soho fruit stall, and Marc would sometimes assist her. His father, Simeon, was a lorry driver.

## The Journey from Mark Feld to Marc Bolan

During his time at Northwold School, Marc played guitar in a group called "Susie and the Hoops" alongside 12-year-old vocalist Helen Shapiro, who found fame before Marc in early 1961 with her first hit, "Walking Back to Happiness". Marc left school as soon as he could in 1962, around the same time he moved from his Stoke Newington Common home. He briefly joined a modelling agency and became a "John Temple Boy," appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store.

The journey from Mark Feld to Marc Bolan began with the stage name Toby Tyler, inspired by a film of the same name. Later, he settled for Marc Bolan, a name derived from the first two and last three letters of his hero, Bo(b) (Dy)lan.

## The Rise of Glam-Rock

Marc Bolan is best known as the founder of the British rock band Tyrannosaurus Rex, which was later abbreviated to T. Rex. His music, as well as his highly original sense of style and extraordinary stage presence, helped create the glam rock era which made him one of the most recognizable stars in British rock music.

## Tragic End

Marc Bolan spent his last night at Morton's bar and restaurant at Berkeley Square, along with his girlfriend Gloria Jones. Gloria drove him home in her Mini 1275GT. Marc never took a driving test or had a licence. Tragically, he died instantly when Jones lost control of the car and it struck a sycamore tree after failing to negotiate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, in South West London at 5 a.m. on 16 September 1977.
